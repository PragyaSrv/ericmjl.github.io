  </p>
  <p>At IMED 2016, I heard a lot of talks surrounding surveillance efforts. Most of it has been syndromic surveillance, because that's what's currently collectable. For digital disease surveillance, search queries (a marker of "interest" in a disease) are used as a proxy for probable presence of a disease.</p>
<p>These are good for real-time surveillance, but I think it's not good enough from the standpoint of accuracy and understanding mechanism.</p>
<p>For accuracy, syndromic surveillance and search queries are n<sup>th</sup>-degree manifestations of underlying causes. Multiple different pathogens can present the same symptoms. Upticks in searches for a given symptom or pathogen may have multiple underlying causes, though "hearing of the disease" and "being concerned about it" may be related to certain diagnoses and local spread of information.</p>
<p>Found data can help act as a very early sentinel to a problem, and can guide us by providing leads to follow-up, but for understanding mechanism, neither tell us how a new virus is going to be dangerous.</p>
<p>In other words, while fast and rapid and local, syndromic surveillance and digital disease surveillance remains a reactive endeavour, because we can't mechanistically forecast risk from the data.</p>
<p>On the other hand, genomic data is often collected with the intention of understanding pathogen dynamics, as we have well-developed phylogenetic tools for this. However, we still rely on single point mutations, identified in small-scale, one-off, ad-hoc, [insert-some-dashed-phrase-that-expresses-frustration] studies, and basically treat the limited amount of evidence as gospel. I am quite sure that is not the right way to do phenotypic interpretation of genomic data.</p>
<p>If we're going to make disease surveillance a <strong>proactive</strong> endeavour, I am convinced that the disease surveillance world will need a paradigm shift, and investment in infrastructure. By predictive, this is what I mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculating what has a high probability of jumping into humans.</li>
<li>Phenotypically testing those viruses without using live viruses (concept of pseudotyping).</li>
<li>Using genomic information to predict phenotype.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's how I see it happening, given everything I've learned at IMED 2016:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Sequence everything, in animals that interface with humans</strong></p>
<p>60-70% of new infections are going to be zoonotic in nature. To know what might be coming up, use metagenomics to sequence animal species in geographic areas that humans, <em>prior</em> to the host switch event. To me, this is a no-brainer. Long-term serial sampling is going to be key.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Leverage pseudotyping technologies and genetic systems, and automation, to create systematic phenotyping platforms</strong></p>
<p>Doing so will allow us to phenotypically test components of a virus for a particular step in its life cycle, such as speed of entry into a cell, or resistance to a drug. With rapid DNA synthesis & assembly technologies, we should be able to experimentally measure a virus' epidemiologically-relevant phenotype within 24 hours of an outbreak. We should also be able to rapidly generate large-scale genotype-phenotype data for machine learning.</p>
<p>What would be relevant phenotypes? I can think of a few, broken down basically to "druggability" and "life cycle steps":</p>
<ol>
<li>For druggable proteins, measure drug resistance. It has high epidemiological relevance, and hence, value.</li>
<li>For viruses targetable by drugs and not alike, measure cellular entry capability.</li>
<li>For identified polymerase complexes, measure replication capacity.</li>
<li>For cellular release machinery, if identified, measure release.</li>
<li>If there's others already existing for which the case can be made for systematic phenotyping, scale the assay up.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(3) Develop machine learning tools that allow for learning of structural properties that determine epi-relevant protein phenotype</strong></p>
<p>By doing so, we can explicitly model epistasis in a protein, and therefore account for epistatic interactions explicitly when developing learning algorithms that map genotype to phenotype. With this kind of technology coupled to the ability to sequence a virus within hours of sample collection, we'll be able to cut down the time for phenotypic interpretation from the order of a day (because of experimentation required) to seconds (because it's a computational prediction). By going Bayesian, we can even model uncertainty in final predictions, thereby aiding decision-making under uncertainty.</p>
<hr>
<p>In conjunction with the "sequence everything" approach, systematic phenotyping and deep learning will allow us to move to a "predictive" paradigm because it'll give us the ability to rationally predict the phenotypic risk of a virus before it even jumps into humans. I see this as an infrastructural project: requiring up-front commitment of time and money. Yet, we know that investments in infrastructure always pay off dividends in a myriad of ways, from time saved to lives saved.</p>
<p>Something I learned from IMED 2016, however, is that epidemiology is an old discipline, and with old disciplines comes a certain tunnel vision on how things should be done. It'll be up to a new and creative generation (i.e. us) to convince the funders and old guard that our new way will add value to the discipline.</p>
