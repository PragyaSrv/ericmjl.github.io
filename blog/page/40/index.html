  <p>This year, I had the privilege of attending PyCon 2015 as a tutorial instructor again. Unlike last year, which was an eye-opener for me, this year, I decided to take a more educational approach, and set a goal to learn as much new things about programming in Python that I didn't previously know.</p>
<h3 id="old/new-things-i-re-/learned">Old/New things I re-/learned</h3><p>In no order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inspired by JakeVDP’s talk: Use <code>numpy</code> functions whenever possible! And try to cast your data/analysis problems in terms of matrices for massive speedups. Re-implementing one problem that I had tried, I experienced a million-fold speedup using <code>numpy</code> compared to pure Python loops. A million fold!</li>
<li>Testing, a practice primarily found in the software development world, is really important for data analytics! I will have a blog post on this coming.</li>
<li>The top data scientists’ workflows sometimes involve weird things like “averaging” multiple models. I think this is simultaneously a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it gets us answers that we need; a curse because it tells us nothing about how the world works. Maybe I’m a bit too much of a scientist. (Update: Booz Allen Hamilton speaker @ today's ODSC said we have to know how the world works, and not just stop at describe what the world looks like. The best comment I've heard to date!)</li>
<li>Network analysis is a trending topic, given the tutorials and talks that I saw. I will update my network analysis tutorial and re-apply for next year as a tutorial instructor. I do wish I could have gone for Sarah Guido’s tutorial.</li>
<li>Continuum Analytics is a company with vision and doing exciting stuff. Props to Travis and his team! I love what they’re doing, building tools for developers and analytics people. I wish them many good years ahead as a company! :)</li>
<li><code>bokeh</code>, built by Continuum Analytics, is pretty awesome.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="incidents-and-infections">Incidents and Infections</h3><p>I had a norovirus infection, and was suffering the symptoms (diarrhea, fever, and fatigue) on the bus to MTL. The symptoms persisted right up to the point my tutorial was due to start. Miraculously, thank God for that, I was able to hold on throughout the tutorial without needing to go to the bathroom once - and I don’t think I passed it to anybody. I collapsed on a couch outside the lunch area in the afternoon, and was spotted by security… “Monsieur? Monsieur?” I hastily grabbed my badge and uttered, “Oui, oui, Pycon!”, which readily stress-tested the extent of my French language knowledge. At thtat point, I went back to the hotel and collapsed again, for 16 hours.</p>
<h3 id="cool-people">Cool People</h3><p>Again, in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Travis Oliphant and Peter Wang, Continuum Analytics</li>
<li>Jake van der Plas, eScience Institute @ UW</li>
<li>Stuart Williams and Ruben Orduz, Tutorial Coordinators</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="feelings">Feelings</h3><p>I’d do PyCon 2016! Hopefully I will have new things that I can share with the community next year. I’m also hoping to be able to do a network analysis &amp; statistics tutorial at SciPy 2016, wherever that may be held.</p>

  <p>A while ago, I backed the Roost Stand on Kickstarter. Of all the things I’ve backed so far, I think the Roost Stand is the only one that I’d consider an investment.</p>
<p>It’s saved my neck from countless hours of pain, especially when working from home.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-home-320px.jpg" alt="roost-home"></p>
<p>It's a daily feature of my workstation.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-desk-320px.jpg" alt="roost-work"></p>
<p>It’s turned coffee shop tables into workstations.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-starbucks-320px.jpg" alt="roost-starbucks"></p>
<p>Taking it around is really portable as well!</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-to-go-320px.jpg" alt="roost-to-go"></p>
<p>Can’t wait to see what the Roost makers have up their sleeves next!</p>

  <p>In writing the current paper I’m working on, I have decided to adopt a semantic versioning scheme for each draft of the paper. There’s probably a ton out there, and I think I got a bit fed up with other versioning schemes where people tag on _INITIALS to the end of the file. Moreover, I found value in tracking the evolution of the paper - in other words, how does the final product look compared to the original? Therefore, I thought, why not adopt a numbering system that semantically makes sense, the same way that it works for code?</p>
<p>Shamelessly copying <a href="http://semver.org">http://semver.org</a>, here’s my proposed scheme.</p>
<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, for a prose body of text, increment the:</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version after each submission, to keep track of the number of times a paper has been submitted.</li>
<li>MINOR version after each:<ol>
<li>re-arrangement of logic,</li>
<li>large word-smithing or rephrasing of things, and</li>
<li>addition of new insights compared to the previous version</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>PATCH version after making:<ol>
<li>grammatical or spelling changes</li>
<li>substitute individual words for other words</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I will note that formatting is intentionally not dealt with here, but is assumed to be part of the MAJOR version increment when formatting a manuscript for submission. This is because a writer ought not to be concerned with formatting in the writing stages. A writer ought to be most concerned with getting his/her thoughts into prose form.</p>
<p>Now, for the figures, which I believe should be developed in parallel but separately from the text.</p>
<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, for a document that lays out the organization of figures, increment the:</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version after each submission.</li>
<li>MINOR version after each:<ol>
<li>addition, removal or rearrangement of figures,</li>
<li>changing of figure representations (i.e. scatterplot changed to 2D histogram),</li>
<li>major changes to the figure caption/legend</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>PATCH version after each:<ol>
<li>grammatical or spelling changes, in the figure caption/legend,</li>
<li>minor word substitutions or additions/deletions in the figure caption/legend,</li>
<li>resizing of figures for aesthetic purposes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, I have tried to keep the figure versions in sync with the text versions to keep things really simple. This system has worked well, as I usually do an export of both the text and the figures at the same time, incrementing whichever needs to be incremented accordingly. When this first manuscript is done, next steps would be to run a ‘diff’ to see how the final version differs from version 0.1.0. Can’t wait for that to happen!</p>

  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>In this blog post, I'll detail how I created a 3D printed QR code that can be used to help guests get on our home guest network in geek style. This part will detail the creation of a QR code with Python. The next part will detail how I created a program to generate 3D printable blocks. The final part will detail how I created a hybrid command line app and Flask app from the same code base, using <code>click</code> and <code>Flask</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2><p>Over the weekend, I embarked on a project to create a 3D printed QR code that guests at our house could scan to gain access to our guest wireless network.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-decided-to-do-this">Why I decided to do this</h2><p>From the standpoint of practicality, sure, it's trivial to open up phone settings, find the WiFi network name, and give them the password, but... this has the coolness factor associated with it! Imagine scanning a 3D-printed QR code! Until this becomes commonplace, it's a cool thing to be able to do.</p>
<p>Anyways, there's a ton of QR code generators out there on the web, and there's more than a handful of WiFi QR code generators out there - so why did I embark on this project?</p>
<p>Partly it's borne out of security reasons - I am not giving my WiFi password up to some random website. Who knows whether they're actually storing the passwords?</p>
<p>Another part of this is borne out of me wanting to scratch my itch surrounding QR codes. The last time I went to China (Xi'an and Shanghai, specifically), I saw QR codes <em>everywhere</em>. There surely had to be something good we could use this for at home that didn't involve just packing and storage.</p>
<h2 id="getting-setup">Getting Setup</h2><p>Ok, let's get started! To create QR codes, all you need are the following packages installed in your environment:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pyqrcode</code> [<code>pip</code>]</li>
<li><code>pypng</code> [<code>pip</code>]</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to do the 3D printing part, you'll need another package:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>SolidPython</code> [<code>pip</code>]</li>
<li><code>numpy</code> [<code>conda</code>/<code>pip</code>]</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if you'd like to work with command line interfaces and Flask, you'll need:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>click</code> [<code>pip</code>/<code>conda</code>]</li>
<li><code>Flask</code> [<code>pip</code>/<code>conda</code>]</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="encoding-wifi-credentials-in-a-qr-code">Encoding WiFi credentials in a QR code</h2><p>Let's start by creating a QR code for our WiFi guest network.</p>
<p>Let's say that these are the security credentials for the network:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSID (a.k.a. Network Name): <code>Family Guest Network</code></li>
<li>Password: <code>vn8h2sncu093y3nd!</code></li>
<li>Security Type (one of WPA or WEP): <code>WPA</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Because QR codes are merely two-dimensional barcodes that encode a string that can be parsed by another program, in order to create a QR-code that is readable for accessing WiFi, we need a string that can be parsed. This string is structured as follows:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>WIFI:S:&lt;SSID&gt;;T:&lt;WPA|WEP|&gt;;P:&lt;password&gt;;;
</pre></div>
<p>So in our case, we would want a string that looks like:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>WIFI:S:Family Guest Network;T:WPA;P:vn8h2sncu093y3nd!;;
</pre></div>
<p>Now, we can code up our Python program do encode the QR code for us. I'll assume you're running Python 3.6 or later.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pyqrcode</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">pq</span>
<span class="n">ssid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Family Guest Network&quot;</span>
<span class="n">security</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;WPA&quot;</span>
<span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;vn8h2sncu093y3nd!&quot;</span>
<span class="n">qr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pq</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="s1">&#39;WIFI:S:{ssid};T:{security};P:{password};;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">qr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">terminal</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
<p>With that block of code, you should get a QR code printed to your terminal, just like that!</p>
<p>Let's say you wanted to do the simple thing, and just have a regular laser/inkjet printer make a printout of the QR code. To do so, you can save the QR code to disk as a PNG file:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">qr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">png</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;home_guest_wifi.png&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>And just like that, you've used Python to create a WiFi QR code!  How easy was that?</p>
<p>Along the way, I also used Kite in the Atom text editor while embarking on this project - this allowed me to view documentation and common usage patterns for the packages I imported.</p>
<p>Now, if you remember that QR codes are just "ASCII strings encoded in a 2D barcode", then you'll know that you can pass any arbitrary string into the <code>pyqrcode.create()</code> function. That means you can come up with any creative use of a short string that needs to be scanned to be useful! For example, you can create business cards with your LinkedIn profile URL embedded in the QR code, or use it to encode a serial number information on your possessions, or more!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the coming blog posts!</p>
