  <p><strong>Note to Reader:</strong> I’d highly suggest reading this blog post on the left half of your screen, and have the <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/hiv-resistance-prediction/blob/master/Predict%20HIV%20Genotype%20from%20Phenotype%20-%20Custom%20Funcs.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> on the right half of your screen. Makes things a bit easier to follow.</p>
<p>I recently have been writing a proposal to conduct some experiments to predict viral RNA polymerase activity, in some standardized unit, from protein genotype. The main application of this would be to be able to conduct quantitative surveillance in a precise fashion. For example, with HIV, as treatment progresses, the virus accumulates mutations that confer resistance. For a physician treating a patient infected with HIV, would it be possible to determine, from sequence data alone, what would be the degree of predicted viral resistance for that patient’s virus?</p>
<p>Knowing fully that this problem has been tackled many times in the past from multiple angles, I wanted to know how easily I could set up an ML workflow to go from sequence to predicted drug resistance. The goal of this blog post is to document how easy it was for me to get up and running, using Python packages really well-written Python packages.</p>
<h2 id="raw-code">Raw Code</h2><p>All of my code can be found on my Github <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/hiv-resistance-prediction">repository</a>. You can also jump directly to the <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/hiv-resistance-prediction/blob/master/Predict%20HIV%20Genotype%20from%20Phenotype%20-%20Custom%20Funcs.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> that I reference code from in this article.</p>
<h2 id="data-source-and-preprocessing">Data Source and Preprocessing</h2><p>I sourced the data from the <a href="http://hivdb.stanford.edu">Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database</a>. Specifically, I downloaded the <a href="http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/genopheno.dataset.html">high quality, filtered set</a> of Genotype-to-Phenotype mappings, for protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. I wrote a few custom functions to preprocess the data, including the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replacing all "<code>-</code>" characters with the consensus sequences. I am guessing that they use the "<code>-</code>" character in place to help highlight where the mutations are; much more human readable.</li>
<li>Removing sequences that had more than one mutation present. Mostly a function of being lazy than anything else.</li>
<li>Removing sequences with ambiguous amino acids. These are a bit harder to deal with down the road. From biological background knowledge, it’s unlikely that excluding them would be detrmimental.</li>
<li>Dropping all conserved amino acid positions. They add nothing to the analysis.</li>
<li>Binarizing the columns. This transforms the letters of the amino acid into a first-pass feature set, in which the binarized columns indicate whether or not an amino acid is present at a given position or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are found in my <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/hiv-resistance-prediction/blob/master/custom_funcs.py">custom_funcs.py</a> module, which I imported into the Jupyter notebooks. Having futzed around for about a day copying/pasting blocks of code, I refactored the code into separate functions for readability, so that only the “business logic” is shown in the notebook.</p>
<h2 id="train/test-split">Train/Test Split</h2><p>It is a standard practice to split the dataset into a training and test set. K-fold cross-validation is quite easy to do using <code>scikit-learn</code>. Given an <code>X</code> and a <code>Y</code> matrix, to split it into <code>X_train</code>, <code>X_test</code>, <code>Y_train</code>, and <code>Y_test</code>, simply do the function call:</p>
<p><code>X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X_binarized, Y)</code></p>
<h2 id="model-training">Model Training</h2><p>To train models, I used the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> package to help. It’s useful to note that <code>scikit-learn</code> has a consistent API - every regressor model has a <code>MODEL.fit()</code> and a <code>MODEL.predict()</code> function. This ‘modular’ style allowed me to wrap the series of function calls into single-line functions, and thus quickly try out a variety of models to see what out-of-box predictive power would be. Using the Random Forest Regressor as an example, I wrapped up the training and plotting phases:</p>
<p><code># Model Training</code>
<code>kwargs = {'n_jobs':-1, 'n_estimators':1000}</code>
<code>rfr, rfr_preds, rfr_mse, rfr_r2 = cf.train_model(*tts_data, model=RandomForestRegressor, modelargs=kwargs)</code></p>
<p><code># Plotting</code>
<code>cf.scatterplot_results(rfr_preds, Y_test, rfr_mse, rfr_r2, DRUG, 'Rand. Forest', figsize=std)</code></p>
<p>Here, <code>cf</code> simply refers to the <code>custom_funcs.py</code> module I wrote to refactor out the repetitive boilerplate code needed.</p>
<p>The ensemble learners also include feature importances, i.e. an identification of the columns in the data that best predict the outcome of interest. I wrapped the feature importances code to make it easy to plot:</p>
<p><code>cf.barplot_feature_importances(rfr, DRUG, 'Rand. Forest', figsize=std)</code></p>
<p>In particular, I used the ensemble learners, which are known to be pretty powerful for learning tasks. And for comparison, I pitted them against a number of linear models as well. As you can see in the notebooks, the ensemble learners outperformed the linear models, at least for a binarized amino acid feature set. This makes intuitive sense - protein sequence to function is non-linear, and highly contextual.</p>
<h2 id="neural-networks">Neural Networks!</h2><p>One of the things I wanted to highlight here was how <a href="http://danielnouri.org">Daniel Nouri’s</a> <a href="https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn">nolearn</a> package made it easy for me to start experimenting with neural networks. By no means am I a deep learning expert - I consider myself too algebra-blind (but by no means code-blind!) to learn the math behind it all. However, I know that my learning style of diving into the deep end and doing a lot of hands-on trials would help me get a fairly good intuitive grasp of how to do it. So after futzing around on a GPU cluster for a few days trying to get it configured right, I got <code>theano</code>, <code>lasagne</code> and <code>nolearn</code> up and running. (Note: A GPU makes light(er) work of training artificial neural nets. CPUs take around 5-10x more time. Highly recommended to use a GPU with neural nets. Shout-out to my PhD thesis committee member, Mark Bathe, for giving me access to his lab's GPU machine!)</p>
<p><code>nolearn</code>’s API is, by design, really close to the <code>scikit-learn</code> API. I find this to be a great thing - since neural networks are basically ML models, we get the familiar <code>neural_net.fit()</code> and <code>neural_net.predict()</code> function calls. (The importance of great APIs! Thank you, @dnouri!) The API also makes specifying a neural network architecture quite easy. For example, in the simple feed-forward network architecture that I show in the Jupyter notebook, network layers are specified as a list of parameters, and each layer’s properties can be specified by using named parameters that sync up with the specified names. The comments in my Jupyter notebook in some of the layers show my (rather simple) efforts in experimenting with different architectures. To note, the original structure of the feed-forward network is directly lifted from <a href="http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/">Daniel Nouri's tutorial</a>, so big thanks to him for publishing it!</p>
<p>FWIW, I also learned from other experienced Pythonistas (shout out to Rick Landau!) for teaching me <em>not</em> to use binary features on neural networks, something I happily disregarded for this first pass. But I’ve nonetheless still remembered that lesson! And in future iterations, probably I will try to change to non-binary features.</p>
<h2 id="summary-amp;-future-work">Summary &amp; Future Work</h2><p>So to summarize, the <code>scikit-learn</code> API makes it pretty easy to get my hands dirty doing machine learning. By keeping a <code>scikit-learn</code>-like API, <code>nolearn</code> also does a great job of keeping neural nets accessible.</p>
<p>What else do I think can be done? Well, there’s one idea I’ve been thinking about, to improve the regression score beyond what experimental error in the dataset may limit us to. Think convolutional networks (convnets) and their data input requirements. Basically, most image recognition convnets need a 2D image. But what if I used a convnet that can take in a 3D image instead? Calculating a numerical value, such as the electrostatic charge at every grid point in a static, modelled 3D protein structure, may be much more informative than simply using binarized amino acid columns. A recent paper that I read in <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/S5/S1">BMC genomics</a> (say "yay" for open access!) uses a computationally efficient shortcut representation to get structural features encoded as well, with great success; I would definitely be game for implementing their version as a first pass as well.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it's insufficient to run only on a single train/test split. There will always be unavoidable biases in the trained model. Training <code>k</code>-fold splits <code>k</code> times is a common practice I've heard. In papers I've read, usually k-fold splits are trained k times, and the standard deviation reported. I can imagine also doing it n times, to get a better feel for the generalization error (assuming the data are representative of the population).</p>

  <p>When you think about software engineering skills, you probably don't think about the analytics types, or data scientist (DS) teams. This is a reasonable thought. Data scientists aren't in the business of building software, they're in the business of using software to analyze data. That said, I think it's still important for a data scientist (or analytics person, for that matter), to know some basic software engineering skills. Here's the why, followed by the what.</p>
<p>Why should an analytics person who uses code to perform analysis care about good software engineering practices?</p>
<ol>
<li>It will help you write better, reusable analysis code.</li>
<li>It will help you when you come back to your analysis code later on.</li>
<li>It will help you integrate with software teams that you may have to work with.</li>
<li>It will help you share the tools that you end up developing.</li>
</ol>
<p>What basic skills should one at least be knowledgeable about, if not able to implement?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Defining specifications:</strong> being able to create specific and precise descriptions of what's needed, using standardized language.</li>
<li><strong>Refactoring:</strong> being able to pull out chunks of code that are repeated, to turn them into function calls.</li>
<li><strong>Writing unit/data tests:</strong> being able to write tests that ensure the integrity of a function or a block of data.</li>
<li><strong>Packaging and distribution:</strong> being able to share the code, with other people.</li>
<li><strong>Version control:</strong> being able to keep track of every meaningful change made to the  code or data.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> being able to explain to someone other than yourself what the software tool or analysis code is all about.</li>
<li><strong>Continual automated testing &amp; integration:</strong> having a continuous integration system automatically run the necessary software and data tests, and report code testing coverage.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Here's where I see them being implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Building your own tools</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the tools that you need to get your work done aren't already written, or they're scattered about. You'll need to write your own tools to get your job done. The history of some Python packages, like <code>numpy</code>, <code>pandas</code> or <code>seaborn</code> were born out of this necessity. Here, the ability to use good software engineering practices as described above will make a huge difference when trying to orient newcomers to the tool and help new contributors jump in easily. And even if you don't end up sharing the code with others, if you still end up reusing your code, all of the above practices will help with codebase maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Developing your analysis pipeline</strong></p>
<p>Your analysis pipeline is the sequence of steps that are needed to get from raw data to interpretable data to insights. Along the way, you may encounter blocks of code that get copy/pasted elsewhere. Or, you might find yourself writing a series of functions that always take the same inputs - necessitating your own OOP-based tool. Knowing good software engineering practices will help you keep your code clean, readable, and reusable across your analysis pipeline. It'll also help others interpret and verify your data analysis steps. Documentation, in this realm, is particularly important.</p>
<p>Data tests, are something software engineers don't do, but you might wish to. Data tests that run on continuous integration platforms serve as an automatically-enforced contract between you, your data provider, and your data delivery. If anything changes, continuous integration should catch it early on, and not later. An example of a data test is ensuring that the number of columns/rows stays the same, or that a hash of the original data file hasn't changed (i.e. data integrity).</p>
<p><strong>Integrating with Data Products</strong></p>
<p>Data scientists in industry don't work in a vacuum: there is usually a software product waiting at the end. Those software products are (hopefully) maintained with good software engineering practices. Getting good at the practice of good software engineering will help lubricate communication and workflows with the software engineers who may be responsible for integrating the new algorithm or analysis pipeline. Even in the academic or government world, where the end product may not be a monolithic system but a series of, perhaps, web dashboards, knowing good software engineering practices will ease the transition from analytics to product.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, any good thing done too much will become a bad thing. Don't over-specify straight from the start, start with something clear enough. Don't over-refactor if it isn't necessary. Don't worry about finding every test case, just test enough so the most common bugs are caught. Or use something like Hypothesis to do property-based testing. (The maintainer threw in the towel recently, citing financial reasons, I think, but as it stands it's already pretty darn good.) Don't package every last tool you develop, only share what's necessary. And over-indulging on documentation can take away from good coding. Write enough for yourself to review your code, and let others help you refine it if it's actually needed. Tracking every little minor change is also probably overdoing it.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

  <p>Conferences are made up of people, just like any other group of human beings grouping together.</p>
<p>What makes one differ from another really boils down to the people.</p>
<p>I read a tweet recently that described the SciPy 2015 conference as having really 'humble' attendees. This was exactly my feeling! It was great to see such a community of developers and scientists who, knowing that while they may be domain experts there is still much to learn, choose to carry themselves in a really humble way.</p>
<p>I think this was one of the reasons why I really enjoyed SciPy. It was devoid of the ego that plagues other field-specific conferences. Yet another reason to go again!</p>

<li>It was fun to set so many new people from a variety of disciplines. This conference was right in the sweet spot of nerdy-ness and social interaction. I think I lost track of the number of business cards I handed out to people, but it's definitely dented my collection!</li>
<li>I learned a lot, particularly about the variety of packages that other people have developed to solve a variety of problems.</li>
<li>Swag! This time it was in the form of a free book by Kurt Smith, on using Cython to speed up Python code. Also got a bunch of stickers. At PyCon, I didn't know where to stick them, and I was hesitant to stick them to my laptop (I like a clean laptop), so I stuck them to my poster tube instead.</li>
<li>I gave a lightning talk on Testing Data, for data integrity purposes. Later, I was contacted by Greg, who leads the Software Carpentry (SWC)initiative, on providing some material on doing data tests. Looks like it could be fun! And I cannot wait to get my own SWC instructor training - c'mon Greg!</li>
<li>My roommate, Chuan, was a physician from China, who was in the Houston area doing a year of research. I had a great time conversing about code and culture with him, and I learned a lot about contemporary Chinese medicine from him.</li>
<li>Finally, I participated in my first ever coding sprint! It was with the matplotlib team. It was a great learning experience, participating in the actual modern git workflows of software development. I helped with making changes to the documented examples, a task suitable to first timer sprinters (as it doesn't risk messing up the established code logic). Seeing my first merged PR to a major software project gave me an absolute thrill :). I also got to observe how to do Continuous Integration with auto testing. Next conference I will most certainly make time for at least part of a coding sprint.</li>
<li>I missed a bunch of talks on the second and third day, because I needed some headspace to finish up thinking about this paper that I am writing. However, because of the great efforts by the AV team that Enthought hired, it's possible to view them online after the conference. This also have those who couldn't attend the conference a chance to access the conference materials. Kudos to them!</li>
</ol>
<p>This year's conference was a really great experience. I learned lots, learned about the many people doing cool stuff with the scientific Python stack, and made new connections with them too. I would highly recommend joining SciPy 2016, and I hope to make it an annual thing with PyCon!</p>
