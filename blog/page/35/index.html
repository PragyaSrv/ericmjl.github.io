<li>Great turnout! People from everywhere - Conneticut, Michigan, Boston, Ukraine etc. Many companies as well.</li>
<li>Hiccups with the workshops.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="on-talks">On Talks</h3><p>All-round mostly high quality talks. Favorites: Booz Allen Hamilton’s opener (4th of the opening talks), in which they encouraged Data Scientists to go beyond correlations and move into finding out causations. Best point I’ve seen about the data science world.</p>
<h3 id="on-job-booths">On Job Booths</h3><p>Darn! It looks like the Broad is more interested in post-docs than staff computational biologists. :( I hope my impressions are wrong.</p>
<h3 id="on-workshops">On Workshops</h3><p>I would run the workshops in the style of PyCon Tutorials. Concentrate them, require participants to pre-register for them, and perhaps pay a refundable deposit for their spot. Refundable deposits via EventBrite are not impossible.</p>
<h3 id="other-suggestions">Other Suggestions</h3><p>Try booking a venue much closer to the entrance, perhaps?</p>
<p>Food - okay, maybe at a low registration fee, not possible to provide. But catering for 1000+ people might be more cost effective than having us buy our own lunches?</p>

  <p>Recently, I’ve just wrapped up the data analysis tasks for one of my projects, and have finally finished the writing up to the stage of being ready for submission. I’m still going to choose to keep it under wraps until it finally gets published somewhere - don’t want to count chickens before they’re hatched! But the paper isn’t the main point of this post; the main point is on the importance of doing tests as part of the data analysis workflow, especially for large data analysis.</p>
<h3 id="why-data-testing?">Why “data testing”?</h3><p>Data comes to us analytics-minded people - but rarely is it structured, cleaned, and ready for analysis &amp; modelling. Even if it were generated by machines, there may be bugs in the data - and by bugs, I mean things we didn’t expect to see about the data. Therefore, I think it’s important for us to check our assumptions about the data, prior to and during analysis, to catch anything that is out of whack. I would argue that the best way to do this is by employing an “automated testing” mindset and framework. Doing this builds a list of data integrity checks that can speed up the catching of bugs during the analysis process, can provide feedback to the data providers/generators. In the event that the data gets updated, we can automatically check the integrity of the datasets that we work with prior to proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-begin-data-testing?">How to begin data testing?</h3><p>As I eventually found out through experience, doing data tests isn’t hard at all. The core requirements are:</p>
<ol>
<li>An automated testing package (e.g. <code>pytest</code>)</li>
<li>A Python script called <code>test_data.py</code>, with functions that express the assumptions one is making about the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get started, ensure that you have Python installed. As usual, I recommend the Anaconda distribution of Python. Once that is installed, install the <code>pytest</code> package by typing in your Terminal: <code>conda install pytest</code>.</p>
<p>Once that is done, in your folder, created a blank script called <code>test_data.py</code>. In this script, you will write functions that express the data integrity tests for your data.</p>
<p>To illustrate some of the basic logic behind testing, I have provided a Github repository of some test data and an example script. The material is available on <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/data-testing-tutorial">https://github.com/ericmjl/data-testing-tutorial</a>. To use this ‘tutorial’ material, you can clone the repo to disk, and install the dependencies mentioned on the Github site.</p>
<p>The example data set provided is a Divvy data set, which is a simple data set on which we can do some tests. There is a clean data set, and a corrupt data set in which one cell of the CSV file has a “hello”, and another cell has a “world” present in the <code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code> columns, defying what one would expect about two of the data columns. If you inspect the data, you will see that there are different columns present.</p>
<p>To begin testing the data, we can write in the following lines of code in the <code>test_data.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd 
data = pd.read_csv('data/Divvy_Stations_2013.csv', index_col=0)
def test_column_latitude_dtype():
    """
    Checks that the dtype of the 'Latitude' column is a float.
        """
    assert data[’atitude’].dtype == float
</code></pre>
<p>If you fire up a Terminal window, <code>cd</code> into the <code>data-testing-tutorial</code> directory, and execute <code>py.test</code>. You should see the following terminal output: <strong><code>1 passed in 0.53 seconds</code></strong>.</p>
<p>If you now change the function to check the <code>data_corrupt</code> DataFrame, such that the assert statement is:</p>
<pre><code>    assert data_corrupt['altitude'].dtype == float
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>py.test</code> output should include the error message:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; assert df['latitude'].dtype == float
E assert dtype('O') == float
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, because the assertion statement failed, you would thus know that the data suffered a corruption.</p>
<p>In this case, there is only one data set that is of interest. However, if you find that it’s important to test more than one file of a similar data set, you can encapsulate the test code in a function call embedded in the test function as such:</p>
<pre><code>def test_column_latitude_dtype():
    ”””
    Checks that the dtype of the 'Latitude' column is a float.
    ”””
    def column_latitude_dtype(df):
        assert df['latitude'].dtype == float
    column_latitude_dtype(data)
    column_latitude_dtype(data_corrupt)
</code></pre>
<p>In this way, you would be testing all of the data files together. You can also opt to do similar encapsulation, abstraction etc. if it helps with automating the test cases. As one speaker once said (as far as my memory can recall), if you use the same block of code twice, encapsulate it in a function.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-continue-testing?">How to continue testing?</h3><p>You can extend the script by adding more test functions. <code>py.test</code> is able to do automated test discovery, by looking for the <code>test_</code> prefix to a function. Therefore, simply make sure all of your test functions have the <code>test_</code> prefix before them.</p>
<p>Need some ideas on when to add more tests?</p>
<ol>
<li>Any time you come up against a bug in your data, add a test.</li>
<li>Any time you think of a new assumption you’re making about the data, add a test.</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy Testing! :D</p>

  <p>This year, I had the privilege of attending PyCon 2015 as a tutorial instructor again. Unlike last year, which was an eye-opener for me, this year, I decided to take a more educational approach, and set a goal to learn as much new things about programming in Python that I didn't previously know.</p>
<h3 id="old/new-things-i-re-/learned">Old/New things I re-/learned</h3><p>In no order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inspired by JakeVDP’s talk: Use <code>numpy</code> functions whenever possible! And try to cast your data/analysis problems in terms of matrices for massive speedups. Re-implementing one problem that I had tried, I experienced a million-fold speedup using <code>numpy</code> compared to pure Python loops. A million fold!</li>
<li>Testing, a practice primarily found in the software development world, is really important for data analytics! I will have a blog post on this coming.</li>
<li>The top data scientists’ workflows sometimes involve weird things like “averaging” multiple models. I think this is simultaneously a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it gets us answers that we need; a curse because it tells us nothing about how the world works. Maybe I’m a bit too much of a scientist. (Update: Booz Allen Hamilton speaker @ today's ODSC said we have to know how the world works, and not just stop at describe what the world looks like. The best comment I've heard to date!)</li>
<li>Network analysis is a trending topic, given the tutorials and talks that I saw. I will update my network analysis tutorial and re-apply for next year as a tutorial instructor. I do wish I could have gone for Sarah Guido’s tutorial.</li>
<li>Continuum Analytics is a company with vision and doing exciting stuff. Props to Travis and his team! I love what they’re doing, building tools for developers and analytics people. I wish them many good years ahead as a company! :)</li>
<li><code>bokeh</code>, built by Continuum Analytics, is pretty awesome.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="incidents-and-infections">Incidents and Infections</h3><p>I had a norovirus infection, and was suffering the symptoms (diarrhea, fever, and fatigue) on the bus to MTL. The symptoms persisted right up to the point my tutorial was due to start. Miraculously, thank God for that, I was able to hold on throughout the tutorial without needing to go to the bathroom once - and I don’t think I passed it to anybody. I collapsed on a couch outside the lunch area in the afternoon, and was spotted by security… “Monsieur? Monsieur?” I hastily grabbed my badge and uttered, “Oui, oui, Pycon!”, which readily stress-tested the extent of my French language knowledge. At thtat point, I went back to the hotel and collapsed again, for 16 hours.</p>
<h3 id="cool-people">Cool People</h3><p>Again, in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Travis Oliphant and Peter Wang, Continuum Analytics</li>
<li>Jake van der Plas, eScience Institute @ UW</li>
<li>Stuart Williams and Ruben Orduz, Tutorial Coordinators</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="feelings">Feelings</h3><p>I’d do PyCon 2016! Hopefully I will have new things that I can share with the community next year. I’m also hoping to be able to do a network analysis &amp; statistics tutorial at SciPy 2016, wherever that may be held.</p>

  <p>A while ago, I backed the Roost Stand on Kickstarter. Of all the things I’ve backed so far, I think the Roost Stand is the only one that I’d consider an investment.</p>
<p>It’s saved my neck from countless hours of pain, especially when working from home.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-home-320px.jpg" alt="roost-home"></p>
<p>It's a daily feature of my workstation.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-desk-320px.jpg" alt="roost-work"></p>
<p>It’s turned coffee shop tables into workstations.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-starbucks-320px.jpg" alt="roost-starbucks"></p>
<p>Taking it around is really portable as well!</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2015/5/1/the-roost-stand/roost-to-go-320px.jpg" alt="roost-to-go"></p>

  <p>In writing the current paper I’m working on, I have decided to adopt a semantic versioning scheme for each draft of the paper. There’s probably a ton out there, and I think I got a bit fed up with other versioning schemes where people tag on _INITIALS to the end of the file. Moreover, I found value in tracking the evolution of the paper - in other words, how does the final product look compared to the original? Therefore, I thought, why not adopt a numbering system that semantically makes sense, the same way that it works for code?</p>
<p>Shamelessly copying <a href="http://semver.org">http://semver.org</a>, here’s my proposed scheme.</p>
<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, for a prose body of text, increment the:</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version after each submission, to keep track of the number of times a paper has been submitted.</li>
<li>MINOR version after each:<ol>
<li>re-arrangement of logic,</li>
<li>large word-smithing or rephrasing of things, and</li>
<li>addition of new insights compared to the previous version</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>PATCH version after making:<ol>
<li>grammatical or spelling changes</li>
<li>substitute individual words for other words</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I will note that formatting is intentionally not dealt with here, but is assumed to be part of the MAJOR version increment when formatting a manuscript for submission. This is because a writer ought not to be concerned with formatting in the writing stages. A writer ought to be most concerned with getting his/her thoughts into prose form.</p>
<p>Now, for the figures, which I believe should be developed in parallel but separately from the text.</p>
<p>Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, for a document that lays out the organization of figures, increment the:</p>
<ol>
<li>MAJOR version after each submission.</li>
<li>MINOR version after each:<ol>
<li>addition, removal or rearrangement of figures,</li>
<li>changing of figure representations (i.e. scatterplot changed to 2D histogram),</li>
<li>major changes to the figure caption/legend</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>PATCH version after each:<ol>
<li>grammatical or spelling changes, in the figure caption/legend,</li>
<li>minor word substitutions or additions/deletions in the figure caption/legend,</li>
<li>resizing of figures for aesthetic purposes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, I have tried to keep the figure versions in sync with the text versions to keep things really simple. This system has worked well, as I usually do an export of both the text and the figures at the same time, incrementing whichever needs to be incremented accordingly. When this first manuscript is done, next steps would be to run a ‘diff’ to see how the final version differs from version 0.1.0. Can’t wait for that to happen!</p>
