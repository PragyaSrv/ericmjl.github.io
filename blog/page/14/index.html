  </p>
  <p>Who would have thought that making stuff could be so fun? (Particularly when the tediousness of actually building it is removed!) I think that the 3D printer I just bought for the lab might really open up new doors for us.</p>
<p>We have the <a href="https://www.makerbot.com/replicator/">MakerBot Replicator 2</a>. MakerBot is one of the leading brands on the market, according to what I've read online. Their printers tend to be on the expensive side, costing upwards of $2000 for a good model. I was lucky that there was a store demo model on sale at Micro Center nearby campus, so I took a ride over and splurged $600 on it.</p>
<p>I did previously have an M3D Micro for the lab, but that was awfully slow, the heater element was unreliable (resulting in poor prints), the quality of the model filling wasn't as good, and the build volumes were really small. Even though it was touted as a PLA printer, the prints also kept warping. I eventually returned it.</p>
<p>MakerBot, by contrast, was fast, had a reliable heater element, had very strong high quality and high resolution prints, and could print much taller objects.</p>
<p>So why did I splurge lab money on a printer? Well, there's a few reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, I've been inspired by the maker movement. I'm also thinking about how I could start my own research group or company. Given the spiralling costs of how to do research, mastering 3D printing now could pay off dividends later, as my group could custom 3D print stuff as we needed it, potentially saving time and money down the road. It'd also give us the freedom to think about what equipment we really need, and then just go ahead and make it.</p>
<p>Secondly, one side project I did just for fun was to build a Raspberry Pi-based remote time-lapse camera to spy on seals on Monomoy and Nantucket (see my <a href="../../../research">research</a>). (The larger context is a "seal infectious disease" project led by my advisor Jon.) I worked on this during December 2015 to January 2016, sort of as a distraction while I was waiting for my paper's reviews to come back. As things turned out, my hacked together Tiki cams (as we called them) didn't perform too shabbily, and we could capture, with high resolution over a long period of time (8+ hours), the qualitative contact structure of the seals. But my hack was fragile and inflexible, and I wanted to print better housings for the case for this year's excursion.</p>
<p>Thirdly, ever since the Ebola 2014 outbreak, and now with the current Zika outbreak, I've been reflecting on how to get labs up and running cheaply in resource-poor regions, thereby bringing molecular diagnostics to regions that don't have access to it. DIY-bio <a href="http://openpcr.org/">PCR machines</a>, <a href="http://pearlbiotech.com/">gel boxes</a>, and <a href="https://www.chaibio.com/openqpcr">RT-PCR</a> kits are one avenue. I think 3D-printing has a role to play as well. Cheap PLA can be brought over with the 3D printer, and within a matter of minutes to hours, parts that are needed may be printed easily, say, extra tube racks where needed.</p>
<p>I'd argue that there's a human side to this as well: objects carry meaning to people, and for those affected by the outbreak, a printer may provide a humanitarian role by allowing a response team to also print designs that are meaningful to the affected people group, perhaps bringing an added element of trust, comfort, and resilience to the population. (Of course, none of this replaces the human acts of empathy and self-sacrifice.)</p>
<p>Finally, I <em>really, really, really</em> wanted to start playing with 3D printing. (Cue the *sheepish look* here.) But we all know that's a quarternary reason, right, right?</p>
<p>In my quest to figure out 3D printing, I've done some test objects.</p>
<p>The MakerBot had a "nut and bolt" design that was my first print on the machine.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/nuts-bolts.jpg" alt="Nut and bolt"></p>
<p>I then used <a href="http://tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad</a> to design a single 50 mL tube holder, and I'm fiddling with designs that'll allow any number of these guys to be chained together.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/tube-holder.jpg" alt="Tube holder."></p>
<p>To commemorate, the purchase of the printer, I've also printed custom keyrings for each of my labmates.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/keyrings.jpg" alt="Keyrings."></p>
<p>To explore the concept of "appropriate tolerances" for objects and the like, and I've printed out a custom business card holder for myself too.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/10/18/3d-printing/business-card-holder.jpg" alt="Business card holder."></p>
<p>My colleague Kim also wants a custom 96-well plate holder for a magnetic bead system that she uses for sequencing, so I'll give that a shot. Later on, once I've finally mastered how to do the design work properly, I'll probably start designing the battery and Raspberry Pi cases for the TikiCam Version 2.</p>

  <p>Just found out about <a href="https://opentrons.com/robots">OpenTrons</a>, which is a company that produces open source robotic liquid handlers for less than $5000. In terms of research budgets, this is amazing!</p>
<p>While some may contend that it may sometimes be faster for a bench scientist to conduct the experiments, I would respond by saying that freeing up the bench scientist from the nitty gritty work of moving small amounts of liquids from one container to another would allow them to focus on higher level thinking, which is what we're trained for. Definitely, conducting the experiments by hand is necessary while establishing a protocol, but once it's settled, having the protocol infinitely replicable by a robot can really free up a ton of time, and more importantly, free up <em>mental energy</em>.</p>
<p>Other good stuff about the robot:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's open source. Hardware + software. This means everything about the hardware and software is introspectable.</li>
<li>It's hackable. The hardware is based on a Raspberry Pi computer, which means I can, as needed, upgrade the Pi, the machine parts, or the software. </li>
</ul>

  </p>
  <p>It's been about 2 months since starting up with the <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/protein-systematic-characterization">GitHub lab notebooks</a> for a project that I'm coordinating. Here's some thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Firstly, version control systems are really powerful as a backup system! Already more than once I've been able to <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/protein-systematic-characterization/pull/33">salvage work</a> that was accidentally over-written.</p>
<p>Secondly, GitHub offers some pretty neat settings that ensure the integrity of a lab notebook and provide for peer review of lab experimental reports. I have my GitHub repo's master branch on lockdown, meaning all new changes to it have to be pulled in from other forks, and the submitter cannot be the reviewer that approves it. With my UROP student now added as a collaborator on the repository, basically we have to approve each other's work before being allowed to merge into master, and can add requests for minor additions that will make the lab experimental report easier to follow. It's akin to signing off on a lab notebook, basically, meaning that the person responsible for the experiment and the person responsible for checking the experiment are both provisioned and tracked.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we've already used the fact that the lab notebook is completely public and online, and therefore completely available 24/7, to <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/protein-systematic-characterization/pull/30">check for mistakes</a> made in previous reports or as-of-yet non-replicable results. Mistakes will always be made, and some results will turn out to be non-replicable, so it's okay to make them once or twice (but not repeatedly, of course); the more important part is that it's publicly recorded, and discussed either in the merging portion or as an issue.</p>
<p>Because everything is digitally recorded, and everything is also distributed, in the event that, say, GitHub goes down, there's at least multiple backups on local computers and local computer backups to restore snapshots of the work. (We will lose all of the commenting history, of course, if GH goes down.)</p>
<p>Because our lab reports use Markdown files with descriptive file names, it's actually possible to write scripts that automatically produce indexes of all experiments conducted for easier browsing. I'm looking forward to seeing what else can be built on top of the file system with version control.</p>

  </p>
  <p>I just saw an awesome pair of blog posts by <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/09/the-care-and-feeding-of-your-scientist-collaborator/">Roger Peng</a> and <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/08/the-care-and-feeding-of-the-biostatistician/">Elizabeth Matsui</a>, detailing how scientists and statisticians can work together more effectively. Highly recommended read! In the duration of my PhD, I've been one of two resident statisticians for our research group (it's a relative expertise thing - I know enough to be dangerous), and so the article really resonated with me. Here's my summary.</p>
<p>Firstly, both ought to take the time to learn each others' core concepts and methods. For the experimentalist, learn some basics about distributions of a random variable and what 'inference' really means beyond p=0.05 (FYI, p<0.05 ≠ inference). For the statistician, take the time to learn some of the basic (bio)chemistry, the experimental setup, and how difficult it is to collect data.</p>
<p>Secondly, have some patience! Both sides will need some time to learn the ins-and-outs of the data collection, analysis, inference reasoning process and the likes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, involve the statistician earlier on in a collaboration, not towards the end. The statistician can help make sense of the scientific question in terms of the data collected, and thus can help with the experimental design.</p>
<p>Fourthly, and this point really matters for PIs, give the statistician sufficient support, particularly on the grants. 1% effort doesn't cut it. Even 5% is on the low side of reasonable. Something more like 10-20% effort makes more sense.</p>
<p>Finally, a statistician's primary goal should be to advance the science through the proper deployment of statistics. A scientist's primary goal is to help identify the most important problems of a (sub-(sub-))field to solve. Together as collaborators, they can find the right experimental design towards this pair of goals.</p>
<p>I'll add in a pointer of my own here - as a statistician, it really shouldn't be about helping your scientist collaborator find "what's significant", which (ahem) often means p<0.05. My view of inference has, over the past year, turned Bayesian, and I'm now increasingly confident in the notion that Bayesian-style reasoning is not only the most natural way to reason through the data, it's actually the right way to do inference on scientific data. Given priors, some perhaps uninformative, about the state of nature, our goal in science is to compute the probability distribution over some parameters of nature.</p>
