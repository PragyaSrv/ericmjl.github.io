  <p>Random thought came to my mind today.</p>
<p>The process of science is the careful observation, measurement, and falsification of hypotheses of the world. It is immensely useful. IMO, a worldview that gives rise to genuine curiosity, meticulousness, and integrity is the only worldview that can give rise to science that is conducted at its best. When that fundamental worldview is absent, basic, curiosity-driven, exploratory science cannot be conducted.</p>
<p>Applied science is the application of science to problems. Think engineering. Biological, chemical, mechanical, electrical engineering. Medicine. IMO, a worldview that seeks the holistic betterment of the human race is the only worldview that can give rise to applied sciences done in the pursuit of a better world. When that fundamental worldview is absent, applied science can only bring about the destruction of the planet, of all creation, of the human race.</p>
<p>A person's worldview matters. Make sure that the fundamental lenses through which we view the world are correct, that they satisfyingly answer the question of origins, morality, purpose and destiny at the level of the emotions, the intellect, and the physical being. Absent this, take the worldview to its logical conclusions, and there can only be despair if it does not satisfy us in these ways.</p>

  <p>In the software development world, I learned about the importance of writing tests for one’s software. Since then, I have incorporated this habit in my own work, where as part of my more recent work, I write tests for the software I write to conduct scientific research.</p>
<p>This has got me thinking about why tests are such an effective tool. I think there’s got to be at least a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tests effectively are a contract between current and future selves. My current self is writing a contract that has to be enforced by changes made by my future self. If future self makes changes that break the contract, tests will catch them. Of course, this all assumes that the conditions under which the contract was written still hold true. If they change, then the contract can be broken.</li>
<li>Tests force my current self to be explicit about what exactly I am writing. This is much better than slapping together a script in a quick-and-dirty fashion. (Granted, there is a time and place for quick-and-dirty scripts.)</li>
<li>When done with (semi-)automatic testing frameworks, such as <code>py.test</code>, the test suite is automatically run from start to finish. This reduces the cognitive load of running the tests one-by-one, and reinforces the cohesiveness of the code logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, so what exactly do I mean by tests? Here’s a few thoughts.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data integrity tests.</strong> By this, I mean tests that are situated in the directory where the data reside, that encode known properties of the data. For example:<ol>
<li>Number of rows.</li>
<li>Number of columns.</li>
<li>The column names.</li>
<li>The hash of each row of data.</li>
<li>The hash of each column of data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Unit tests.</strong> By this, I mean tests that are written that ensure that a function does exactly what it’s expected to do. This is the most common concept of a test. This is applicable to:<ol>
<li>Code that are written to manipulate data.</li>
<li>Code written that are part of a software package or software utility developed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While it takes time, I think computational scientists should write tests for their code as a matter of routine practice. Not sure if good test writing is enforceable, but it should definitely be done more.</p>

  <p>I’ve heard this refrain many times. However, the distinction never really made sense to me.</p>
<p>R and Python are merely programming languages. You don’t have to do stats in R and data processing in Python. You can do data processing in R, and statistics in Python.</p>
<p><em>What is R?</em> It’s a programming language designed by statisticians, and so there’s tons of one-liner functions to do stats easily.</p>
<p><em>What is Python?</em> It’s a programming language that’s really well-designed for general purpose computing, so it’s really expressive, and others can build tools on top of it.</p>
<p><em>What is data processing?</em> I don’t think I can do justice to its definition here, but I’ll offer my own simple take: making data usable for other programming functions.</p>
<p><em>What is statistics?</em> I think statistics, at its core, is really about describing/summarizing data, and figuring out how probable our data came from some model of randomness. That’s all it is, and it’s all about playing with numbers, really. There’s nothing more than that. <em>Technically, you can do statistics in any programming language, because technically, all programming languages deal with numbers...</em></p>
<p>Which brings me to the point I want to make - as long as you have data, and you’re doing data science, you <em>technically</em> can use any language for it; the differences are not in the language itself, but in the ecosystem, ease-of-use, and other aspects.</p>
<p>Other bloggers have written about <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/">the benefits</a> of using a single language, which include:</p>
<p><ol>
    <li>No cognitive costs associated with syntax switching (the biggest reason for me).</li>
    <li>No need to worry about interfacing between languages.</li>
    <li>No need to pepper file I/O calls throughout the code for each portion of the project that uses its own language.</li>
</ol>
So how do you choose? Here’s my criteria (beyond simply Python and R):</p>
<p><ol>
    <li>What is the larger context of your project? Do you have colleagues you are interfacing with? What languages are they using?</li>
    <li>Are there packages that allow you to do stuff related to your project in a quick-and-dirty fashion?</li>
    <li>Is the language able to use other language’s packages?</li>
    <li>How mature is the package ecosystem for your language? Do you foresee using other packages as your project expands?</li>
</ol>
So I hope the point is clear: it isn’t so much that “R is for statistics and Python is for data processing”. I think commoner programmers have to get that dogma out of their heads. It’s simply that R was designed by statisticians for doing statistics, while an ecosystem of Python tools sprung up to do data processing. Nowadays, as the R-blogger <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/">mentioned</a>, Python can also do a ton of stuff that R can do, because packages are being written that replicate R package functionality and more, such as how <a href="http://www.continuum.io">Continuum Analytics</a> (awesome company!) wrote the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org">bokeh</a> package that allows us Pythonistas to deploy web-based data visualizations. Likewise, R can do a ton of stuff that used to be the domain of Python, and it's getting a lot of corporate support from Microsoft. So choose according to your needs.</p>
<p>After all, as Wes McKinney <a href="http://wesmckinney.com/blog/the-problem-with-the-data-science-language-wars/">wrote</a>, the real problem isn't R vs. Python. It's the ability to move data seamlessly.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, I presented my work on influenza ecology and evolution at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/infectious-disease-program/infectious-disease-program">Infectious Disease Program</a> seminar series at the <a href="http://broadinstitute.org">Broad Institute</a>. Most of the talks I've seen there were Keynote or PowerPoint slide deck talks, and so this time round, I thought I might shake things up and do a chalk talk (or whiteboard talk) instead. The whirlwind that went through my mind after the talk meant that it's only today that, with a clear mind, I could find the time and space to write about it.</p>
<p>I think it was quite a fun experience. In terms of preparation, I found it to be much less stressful than doing a slide deck, because it meant I was not fiddling around with software trying to get proportions and alignments perfect. I gave myself two rounds of talking through the material on a blackboard as preparation as well. Finally, I put a set of sketches in my notebook as a reference during the talk (particularly because there was one computation toy example which I found a bit difficult to commit to memory). During the talk, the audience was quite encouraging, and I remember seeing a good amount of nodding of understanding (no droopy eyes), and there was a good amount of positive interruption from the audience for questions and such. After the talk, I also had the opportunity to interact with the audience, and get some feedback from my host, <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/daniel-park-phd">Danny Park</a>, on how it went.</p>
<p>On reflection, there’s some things I’ve learned from doing my first public chalk talk:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s much less stressful to prepare for. I’m beginning to feel that slide decks are way too restrictive, both for preparation and delivery. </li>
<li>Danny commented that because of the nature of the chalk talk, where the speaker has to write down important points, the pace of the talk slows down to a much more comfortable pace for the audience. My colleague, <a href="https://runstadlerlab.mit.edu/people/nichola-hill">Nichola</a>, also mentioned the same point after the talk.</li>
<li>I think I could have done better with polishing the delivery. One example would be being less repetitive, which is something I notice happens quite a bit.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think chalk talks should become the norm again, especially for research talks, where the ideas are complex and the presenter is forced to give a simplified version of the logic behind an experiment or an analysis. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_bohannon_dance_vs_powerpoint_a_modest_proposal?language=en">Imagine how big of an impact we could have if we didn’t waste people’s time with poorly made PowerPoint slides and poorly delivered talks</a>!</p>

  <p>This past Monday, I led a hands-on session at the <a href="http://broadinstitute.org">Broad Institute</a>, showing how to use the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> API, as well as common coding patterns for running machine learning algorithms on the data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ericmajinglong.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160208_132009.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-525"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-525 size-large" src="http://www.ericmajinglong.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_20160208_132009-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_20160208_132009" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>First off, I was totally surprised at how many people signed up for the event - it "sold out" (tickets were free) within 3 hours of opening registration. I was quite floored - and I know it's not because I'm some famous dude who knows ML algorithms. Rather, it told me and my co-organizers that there is most certainly great demand here for this topic, and it should be run again.</p>
<p>I found it to be a great opportunity to put some of my <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>/<a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> tools to use. For example, we used sticky notes to indicate class progress (we used blue for "all done", and red for "need help"). I also tried to ensure that participants could walk away from the tutorial knowing how to do something that they could use immediately in their research.</p>
<p>The examples I used (<a href="http://github.com/ericmjl/scikit-learn-tutorial/">hosted openly on Github</a>) were based on transforming sequence information into a sequence feature matrix, which is then fed into a selected machine learning algorithm. I think this seemed to suit the crowd, but I would love to use different examples as well, for example microbiome data or transcriptomics data.</p>
<p>Feedback given by the participants was overall quite positive. To some, I could have explained things a bit more clearly, which I could recognize as an area I will need to improve on for delivering a second round. Others loved the hands-on instruction; in their feedback it was just the right delivery format for the workshop.</p>
<p>One participant asked me, "Why do you host these workshops?" (I had done one on statistics with some fellow BE colleagues.) I hadn't thought much about that question, so my instinctive response was, "For fun - I'm finding ways to share knowledge, for the benefit of the community." I stand by that thought, as I think it's important for knowledge-bearers to make copies of their knowledge, for the sake of giving back to the community. Yet, stemming from knowledge of myself, I also think that sharing programming knowledge around is an insurance policy against personal stagnation. Put in simple terms, if others know how to wield the tools that I know how to do, then I had better continue levelling up my skill to stand out. It also gets boring and sometimes frustrating person after a while being the "go-to" person for things ML-related or computing-related; it means I can't devote time to exploring new things. So sharing is fun, and is an insurance policy against boredom and frustration - why not share then? :)</p>
<p>All in all, looking forward to reporting on the workshop at the next Broad NextGen meeting, and hosting another iteration at a later time!</p>
