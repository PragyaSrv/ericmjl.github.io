  <p>I finally did it!</p>
<p>The city of Boston recently released their <a href="http://data.boston.gov/">data</a> in the open. I wanted to have an excuse to play with geospatial data, so as a distraction from thesis &amp; proposal writing, I hunkered down for about a workday's worth of time and put together a <a href="http://github.com/ericmjl/boston-gov-data/">bokeh app</a>.</p>
<p>In this web app, the end user can select from one of a number of geospatial datasets released, and visualize the distribution of those data points. There's no added metadata right now, but if I get fed up with thesis &amp; proposal writing I might go back and add in metadata hover/tooltips.</p>
<p>I hope you have fun cloning the repo and running it!</p>

  <p>This evening, I saw a Tweet about using <code>numba</code>, and I thought, it's about time I give it a proper shot. I had been solving some dynamic programming problems just for fun, and I thought this would be a good test case for <code>numba</code>'s capabilities.</p>
<p>The DP problem I was trying to solve was that of collecting apples on a grid. Here's how the problem is posed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a number of apples distributed randomly on a grid. I start at the top-left hand corner, and I'm only allowed to move downwards or to the right. Along the way, I pick up apples. What's the maximum number of apples I can pick up along the way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a classic 2-dimensional DP problem. I simulated some random integers:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">200</span>
<span class="n">arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">low</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">high</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reshape</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>I then wrote out my solution, and wrapped it in two versions of the function call: one native and one numba-JIT'd.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, all that you need is a visual cue on whether the data you have on hand are complete or not. Looking at a table can be dizzying at times, so I'm very glad I found this packaged called <a href="https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno"><code>missingno</code></a>! It provides a way to quickly visualize the <strong>"nullity"</strong> of your dataset. See an example below:</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/2/6/data-diagnostics-missingno/data-completeness.jpg"><img src="../../../blog/2017/2/6/data-diagnostics-missingno/data-completeness-small.jpg" alt="Displaying nullity of a data set."></a></p>
<p>It's built on top of <code>matplotlib</code>, and takes in <code>pandas</code> DataFrames, which means it plays very nicely with the rest of the PyData stack. I recently took it for a tour when I did a quick stats consult with Mia Lieberman (DCM); the above plot was made using her data, used with permission.</p>
<p>Highly recommended package!</p>

  </p>
  <p>I have finished my first complete job interview! I'm happy for the experience, no matter what the result is, as it's a very eye-opening one. I've been in an ivory tower for quite a while, so going out and seeing what the experience like is worthwhile enough, even though it'd also be a very nice icing on the cake to have a job offer too.</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, I'm bound by NDA not to write/speak about the specifics of the interview, but I probably can speak about it in general. Overall, they were very welcoming! I was lodged in a very nice hotel just 6 minutes away from Verily by foot, with breakfast included (yum!). 5 people served as my interviewers, and I had lunch with a more senior person to learn more about the company's history; turns out 2 of them share a Boston connection as well.</p>
<p>There was a good mix of coding and biology, and after the interview, I immediately went back and coded up my answer to my second interviewer's questions... only to find out I had done it wrong! Oh well :-). What's done is done, and I now know the combinatorics functions in the Python standard library much better.</p>
<p>I also went back and thought more about the other coding problem, asked by my final interviewer. It was a frequentist statistics question, and I had been very much in a Bayesian frame of mind when he asked the question, so I was tripped up by my own biases when that happened. (There are foundational philosophical differences between the Bayesian and frequentist statistical mind sets, but I won't go in that direction.)</p>
<p>Three of my other interviewers are very interested in the biological question behind what I was working on, and so I had a much smoother time (I think) with them. One was a wet bench scientist, and the other two do computation work as part of the computational biology team. I also think that my time with them played to my strengths, which are translating the biological problems into code, rather than making algorithms efficient. Not that I'm ruling out learning how to write efficient algorithms, though - I'd definitely love to master that! I say that my time with them played to my strengths because I was able to show them the thought process of how I turned a biological problem into a computable problem, and was able to highlight where the limitations of what I did were. My third and fourth interviewers took a deep interest in my work, and I was really, really happy to share with them what I'd been doing.</p>
<p>Overall, a very fun experience! Big thanks to the HR and Comp Bio teams there, it was an intense day, but it was also very fun. I'm now just waiting for my red-eye flight to go back to Boston to teach a Data Carpentry workshop at Tufts Medical. Hope I survive till noon tomorrow!</p>

  </p>
  <p>I finally did it - I built a Bokeh server app for myself!</p>
<p>All of last week, I brought my UROP student Vivian and a fellow church friend Lin to the "Data Science with Python" <a href="http://computefest.seas.harvard.edu">skill-building workshop series</a>, hosted by the <a href="http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard IACS</a>.</p>
<p>As I already knew most of what was going to be taught, I decided that it'd be a fun thing to try playing with the dataset that they used for the contest. (Having a contest was also extra motivation to try building something I've never done before.)</p>
<p>The goal of the contest was "to build a visualization of the UCI forest dataset that would help an analyst make decisions". The UCI forest dataset basically asks us to predict forest cover type from cartographic variables. As I had always wanted to use Bokeh to build a data dashboard, I thought I should give it a shot with the UCI dataset.</p>
<p>What I eventually built were two things. The first one was a linked scatter-plot dashboard to visualize how the quantitative variables varied with one another and how they grouped by forest cover type. Here, the user can select the two variables that they want to visualize together, using drop-down menus.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehscatter-full.png"><img src="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehscatter-small.png" alt="Bokeh scatterplot"></a></p>
<p>The second one was a bar chart showing the mutual information between the categorical variable values and the forest cover type. Here, the user can select from over 40+ variables, and their mutual information score will be displayed as one of the bars in the bar chart.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehselect-full.png"><img src="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehselect-small.png" alt="Bokeh select"></a></p>
<p>As usual, I copied heavily from the examples and then modified it for my own use. Breaking the copied app helped me figure out where my cognitive blind spots were.</p>
<p>Here's what I've learned.</p>
<p>Firstly, I finally have wrapped my head around callback functions and their use in GUI applications. The idea behind callbacks is that when I click on a GUI element (e.g. button) or change the GUI element's state (e.g. selecting a checkbox, typing into a textbox), that function is called that "does something". What's that something? Well, it's any action I decide that needs to be taken.</p>
<p>Secondly, I finally figured out how non-intimidating Bokeh server really is. It's like... Flask, except for data visualizations. And it takes care of most of the HTML hard lifting for the data visualization portion.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I finally got 'linked plots' working, in which the axes scales or data selections are shared across plots. I noticed it works when using the mid-level "plotting" interface, but doesn't work when using the high-level "charts" interface. Definitely something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I saw how Bokeh server allows us to write custom Python code for callbacks. At least for me, it's much more user-friendly this way, as I find JS idioms to be a bit wonky. Maybe I'm just not used to them. Either way, being able to use custom Python means I'm able to do things like filtering Pandas DataFrames before pushing the data onto the plot.</p>
<p>Finally, I got to use the VBar contribution I made to the Bokeh library last year! Though I eventually moved my bar plots to the "charts"-level API, my initial implementation was done using the "plotting"-level API. It brought me a modicum of satisfaction to use the <code>vbar</code> glyph, something that I had contributed (of course, acknowledging the amount of hand-holding provided by Sarah Bird and Bryan Van De Ven, who are the lead developers of Bokeh).</p>
