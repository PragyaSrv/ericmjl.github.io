  <p>I have finished my first complete job interview! I'm happy for the experience, no matter what the result is, as it's a very eye-opening one. I've been in an ivory tower for quite a while, so going out and seeing what the experience like is worthwhile enough, even though it'd also be a very nice icing on the cake to have a job offer too.</p>
<p>If I'm not mistaken, I'm bound by NDA not to write/speak about the specifics of the interview, but I probably can speak about it in general. Overall, they were very welcoming! I was lodged in a very nice hotel just 6 minutes away from Verily by foot, with breakfast included (yum!). 5 people served as my interviewers, and I had lunch with a more senior person to learn more about the company's history; turns out 2 of them share a Boston connection as well.</p>
<p>There was a good mix of coding and biology, and after the interview, I immediately went back and coded up my answer to my second interviewer's questions... only to find out I had done it wrong! Oh well :-). What's done is done, and I now know the combinatorics functions in the Python standard library much better.</p>
<p>I also went back and thought more about the other coding problem, asked by my final interviewer. It was a frequentist statistics question, and I had been very much in a Bayesian frame of mind when he asked the question, so I was tripped up by my own biases when that happened. (There are foundational philosophical differences between the Bayesian and frequentist statistical mind sets, but I won't go in that direction.)</p>
<p>Three of my other interviewers are very interested in the biological question behind what I was working on, and so I had a much smoother time (I think) with them. One was a wet bench scientist, and the other two do computation work as part of the computational biology team. I also think that my time with them played to my strengths, which are translating the biological problems into code, rather than making algorithms efficient. Not that I'm ruling out learning how to write efficient algorithms, though - I'd definitely love to master that! I say that my time with them played to my strengths because I was able to show them the thought process of how I turned a biological problem into a computable problem, and was able to highlight where the limitations of what I did were. My third and fourth interviewers took a deep interest in my work, and I was really, really happy to share with them what I'd been doing.</p>
<p>Overall, a very fun experience! Big thanks to the HR and Comp Bio teams there, it was an intense day, but it was also very fun. I'm now just waiting for my red-eye flight to go back to Boston to teach a Data Carpentry workshop at Tufts Medical. Hope I survive till noon tomorrow!</p>

  <p>I finally did it - I built a Bokeh server app for myself!</p>
<p>All of last week, I brought my UROP student Vivian and a fellow church friend Lin to the "Data Science with Python" <a href="http://computefest.seas.harvard.edu">skill-building workshop series</a>, hosted by the <a href="http://iacs.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard IACS</a>.</p>
<p>As I already knew most of what was going to be taught, I decided that it'd be a fun thing to try playing with the dataset that they used for the contest. (Having a contest was also extra motivation to try building something I've never done before.)</p>
<p>The goal of the contest was "to build a visualization of the UCI forest dataset that would help an analyst make decisions". The UCI forest dataset basically asks us to predict forest cover type from cartographic variables. As I had always wanted to use Bokeh to build a data dashboard, I thought I should give it a shot with the UCI dataset.</p>
<p>What I eventually built were two things. The first one was a linked scatter-plot dashboard to visualize how the quantitative variables varied with one another and how they grouped by forest cover type. Here, the user can select the two variables that they want to visualize together, using drop-down menus.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehscatter-full.png"><img src="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehscatter-small.png" alt="Bokeh scatterplot"></a></p>
<p>The second one was a bar chart showing the mutual information between the categorical variable values and the forest cover type. Here, the user can select from over 40+ variables, and their mutual information score will be displayed as one of the bars in the bar chart.</p>
<p><a href="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehselect-full.png"><img src="../../../blog/2017/1/17/building-bokeh-apps/bokehselect-small.png" alt="Bokeh select"></a></p>
<p>As usual, I copied heavily from the examples and then modified it for my own use. Breaking the copied app helped me figure out where my cognitive blind spots were.</p>
<p>Here's what I've learned.</p>
<p>Firstly, I finally have wrapped my head around callback functions and their use in GUI applications. The idea behind callbacks is that when I click on a GUI element (e.g. button) or change the GUI element's state (e.g. selecting a checkbox, typing into a textbox), that function is called that "does something". What's that something? Well, it's any action I decide that needs to be taken.</p>
<p>Secondly, I finally figured out how non-intimidating Bokeh server really is. It's like... Flask, except for data visualizations. And it takes care of most of the HTML hard lifting for the data visualization portion.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I finally got 'linked plots' working, in which the axes scales or data selections are shared across plots. I noticed it works when using the mid-level "plotting" interface, but doesn't work when using the high-level "charts" interface. Definitely something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Fourthly, I saw how Bokeh server allows us to write custom Python code for callbacks. At least for me, it's much more user-friendly this way, as I find JS idioms to be a bit wonky. Maybe I'm just not used to them. Either way, being able to use custom Python means I'm able to do things like filtering Pandas DataFrames before pushing the data onto the plot.</p>
<p>Finally, I got to use the VBar contribution I made to the Bokeh library last year! Though I eventually moved my bar plots to the "charts"-level API, my initial implementation was done using the "plotting"-level API. It brought me a modicum of satisfaction to use the <code>vbar</code> glyph, something that I had contributed (of course, acknowledging the amount of hand-holding provided by Sarah Bird and Bryan Van De Ven, who are the lead developers of Bokeh).</p>
<p>My code can be found online <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/iacs2017">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Though I will admit to being somewhat algebra-blind (more on that later), I wasn't necessarily <em>bad</em> at math concepts. I did have one big problem with the way I was learning math, though - it always seemed to be more theoretical and less applied, as if solving puzzles for solving puzzles' sake was the best way to approach learning math.</p>
<p>I'll grant that, yes, many mathematicians and statisticians I know, are one of those types where doing and learning math doesn't have to be tied to some applied goal, and for whom math is viewed as intrinsically fun. But... I'm not one of those types, and it was for this reason I nearly abandoned quantitative thinking in my undergrad. Math was boring after Science One, because I wasn't shown how it was applicable to real-world problems in upper-year courses. Yet, after this PhD, I'll have essentially developed an area of expertise in some hybrid of statistical evolutionary biology and deep learning for biochemistry. Makes me wonder whether the current mode of puzzle-/theory-driven math (and perhaps even CS) is actually driving off people who might not be interested in the intrinsic fun of math, and are more interested in the applied fun?</p>
<p>Science One math was taught by Leah Keshet and Mark MacLean. The part I remember most vividly was learning about differential equations as applied to ecological problems and biochemical reaction kinetics. Along the way, we had to learn differentiation and integration... not for differentiation and integration's sake, but for figuring out useful properties of these two wildly different systems. <em>Now that was amazing math.</em></p>
<p><em>What do I mean by algebra-blind?</em> I basically mean that I tend to confuse algebraic symbols, and can't hold them in my head without having some lookup-table/glossary for what they mean. The lookup-table of algebraic symbols to their meaning was a hack that I never mastered until I finished formal math education; yet it was extremely helpful to have when I was discussing math with my collaborators up at Harvard. Most of my score deductions in math tests came from confusing algebraic symbols with one another...</p>

  <p>One tenet of open science is the notion of "being able to inspect the source code". It's a good, lofty goal, but it comes with a big assumption that I think needs to be made clear.</p>
<p>This assumption is that scientists who are reviewing papers that incorporate code are capable of accurately interpreting the source code in a reasonable amount of time, have a sufficient working knowledge of the language that the work is implemented in, while also possessing sufficient domain knowledge to review the paper.</p>
<p>That middle point is the current sore point. In certain fields, such as artificial intelligence/machine learning and computational biology (both my pet fields), this is not an issue, as the substrate of scientific work is code. On the other hand, there's the scenario of experimental work that is analyzed with custom code. Here, the substrate of the scientific work is not primarily the code, it is the experiment. Reviewers who evaluate this type of work may not necessarily have the expertise to inspect the source code of the pipeline. I am not aware of journals whose editors make the extra effort to solicit a team of reviewers capable of covering both experimental design and code inspection.</p>
<p>To be just a tad more pedantic, I'd insist that code inspection is important. Having myself reviewed a paper for PLoS Computational Biology, I was interested in the <em>accuracy</em> of the implementation (done in R), not simply whether I could re-run the code and obtain the same results (<em>reproducibility</em>).</p>
<p>(Side note: though I'm a Python person, I'd be happy to review R code, though I would do so with the recognition that I'm not as well-versed in R idioms and coding patterns as I am with Python's. I'd be less-than-fully-qualified under the "sufficient working knowledge" criteria.)</p>
<p>In summary, my claim here is that openness requires more scientists who are also technically qualified, in order to achieve the goal of reproducibility + veracity. Without the ability to inspect source code, we're only left with reproducibility, which is not good enough.</p>

  <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1><p>This winter, I decided to embark on a coding project purely for fun. In preparation to build my own Raspberry Pi photo display, I wanted to build an easily-installable, portable (across operating systems) and completely hackable stand-alone image displayer. This project ended up being an awesome way to get myself familiarized with a wide variety of concepts in web development, software packaging, and software distribution. I learned a ton, and I want to share the process behind it.</p>
<p>The design goals were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>It does one and only one thing well: run the app from any directory, and show the photos in that directory in a random order.</li>
<li>It has to be easily distributable. I chose to use <code>pip</code> as my distribution mechanism, partly because of familiarity, partly be cause it is sufficiently ubiquitous (with Python).</li>
<li>It should be completely hackable. My source code is up on <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/imgdisplay">GitHub</a>. Anybody can fork it, hack it, and redistribute it. Go for it - it's BSD-3 licensed!</li>
</ol>
<p>The philosophical goals were pretty simple. Learn how to do the whole stack from scratch, and be free from commercial, closed-source software constraints by being free to build exactly what I need from reusable components.</p>
<h1 id="writing-the-app-logic">Writing the App Logic</h1><p>My choice of tools were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Python</code> 3.5</li>
<li><code>Flask</code>: great framework for web development in Python. Provides glue between Python and HTML.</li>
<li><code>pywebview</code>: provides native GUI wrappers for each platform.</li>
<li><code>click</code>: awesome framework for command-line options.</li>
</ul>
<p>My thought process here was as such: write the user-facing interface using HTML, and write application logic in Python, and we get automatic cross-platform portability. Run the app from the command-line, which is the lowest-common denominator for running applications.</p>
<p>I structured my app as follows:</p>
<pre><code>+ imgdisplay/
    + imgdisplay/
        + __init__.py
        + imgdisplay.py  # this is where the main application logic is found.
        + static/
            + styling.css
        + templates/
            + img.html
    + .gitignore
    + LICENSE
    + MANIFEST.in
    + README.md
    + requirements.txt
    + setup.py
</code></pre>
<p>By most standards, this (at least in the eyes of pros) is probably a very, very simple Flask app.</p>
<p>The app logic was the first part that I tackled. Let's start with the file <code>imgdisplay.py</code>.</p>

<p>Here, we instantiate a Flask instance called <code>app</code>. The <code>tmpl_dir</code> variable was later added on, because I later learned that Flask apps had to look within the project directory for the <code>templates</code> folder; this variable ensures that the correct template directory path is specified.</p>

<p>This is Flask's "hello world" function expanded. What we're doing here is reading a list of <code>.jpg</code> files from the bash shell's current working directory. If there are images present, we tell choose one file, and tell Flask to render the template (<code>render_template</code>) <code>img.html</code> passing in an <code>image</code> to the <code>image</code> keyword argument. If none, we pass in an error text message to the <code>error</code> keyword argument.</p>
<p>If this were a more complicated app, we would probably move to an MVC-like model, where the application logic would be in an importable module adjacent to the rendering code. Here, because the logic is simple enough, and only really amounts to three lines of Python, it's simple enough to not require placing it in a separate Python module.</p>
<p>I think at this point, it's best to show how these will get rendered. Below is <code>img.html</code>, the template that is being used.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>

<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

        {% endif %}

        {% if error %}
          <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span> <span class="na">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;color:white&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
              {{ error }}
          <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        {% endif %}
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">body</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Flask uses <code>jinja2</code> templating - what this basically means is that we can insert Python-like code into other text-based files, allowing for passed in values to be substituted. For example, consider the block below:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>{% if error %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span> <span class="na">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;color:white&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      {{ error }}
  <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</pre></div>
<p>What this is essentially saying is: if the "error" keyword from <code>render_template</code> is not a null value, fill in the value passed to the <code>error</code> keyword (<code>{{ error }}</code>).</p>
<p>What about the header? It's got something much more complicated in there, the <code>url_for</code> function.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="na">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ url_for(&#39;static&#39;, filename=&#39;styling.css&#39;) }}&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">http-equiv</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;refresh&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;5&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">head</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What this is saying here is render the URL for (<code>url_for</code>) the static directory to load the CSS file <code>styling.css</code>, which allows us to use the static CSS file to style the user interface appropriately. If you inspect the HTML source after rendering, you will see that it maps to <code>/static/styling.css</code>.</p>
<p>What about the image?</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>{% if image %}
  <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ url_for(&#39;random_image&#39;, imgname=image) }}&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">img</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</pre></div>
<p>It's a bit complicated, so let me try my best to explain what's going on. This uses the <code>url_for</code> function, which is Flask magic for saying, "render the URL for a particular function" (<code>{{ url_for('random_image',...</code>), while passing in the necessary keywords arguments to that function (<code>... imgname=image) }}</code>). But... where did the <code>random_image</code> function come from, and why is it's keyword arguments named as <code>imgname</code>?</p>
<p>Well, that's the best segue into Section C.</p>
<h2 id="section-c:-random_image...?">Section C: random_image...?!</h2><p>If by the end of my own explanation you don't get it, don't worry. The inner workings remain a bit of black magic to me still. Here's the code:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/image/&lt;path:imgname&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">random_image</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">imgname</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">send_from_directory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getcwd</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">imgname</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">as_attachment</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This function is what is called in the <code>img.html</code> template. The function takes in an image name <code>imgname</code> keyword argument, which is then passed to Flask's <code>send_from_directory()</code> function. Here, we are essentially saying, "get the file <code>imgname</code> from the directory <code>os.getcwd()</code>, as an attachment (<code>as_attachment=True</code>), and send it to Flask."</p>
<p>Somehow, this provides the correct way to send the image file to the browser renderer.</p>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> Figuring this out turned out to be the better of a whole day's worth of debugging and reading through the Flask package documentation, plus another half a day on Stack Overflow trying to figure out the right coding patterns. Once I figured this out, almost everything else fell into place for the minimum-viable-product version of the app.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>This part of the code was totally inspired by <a href="https://joecodeswell.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/flask-with-pywebview-example/">Joe Dorocak</a>, but I had to modify it a little bit to fit my use case (using <code>console_scripts</code> as part of the <code>entry_points</code>). The idea here for this code is to create a new thread that runs the app, and then use pywebview to open a new GUI window that loads the appropriate URL. The other big idea is that I could invoke <code>imgdisplay</code> from the command-line using the call:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>$ imgdisplay
</pre></div>
<p>In order to do so, everything that needs to happen when executing has to happen within the function that the <code>imgdisplay</code> bash command is mapped to; which happens to be <code>start_server</code>. Joe's example puts all of the logic under <code>if __name__ == __main__</code>, because the assumption there is that the code is executed by running:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>$ python imgdisplay.py
</pre></div>
<p>According to the design goals stated above, the former fulfills the goals better than the latter, because in the latter, I would have to copy <code>imgdisplay.py</code> into the directory that I needed. Therefore, I had to hack Joe's example a tiny bit to get it to work the way I wanted. If there's a better way to do it, I'd love to hear!</p>
<h2 id="section-e:-execution">Section E: Execution</h2><div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">start_server</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is boilerplate, but in case anybody wants to run the script from the main project folder (<code>imgdisplay/</code>), for whatever reason, they'd be able to.</p>
<h1 id="styling">Styling</h1><p>I did my prototyping using Chrome on macOS Sierra. The order in which I presented the code above corresponded roughly to the order in which the code became more and more complex. I had to iterate between coding + testing in the browser. Styling was a pretty fun part of the iteration process. Here's my CSS code:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">html</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">600</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">font-family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;PT Sans&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">padding-left</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">padding-right</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">padding-top</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">padding-bottom</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="kt">rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">div</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">max-width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">max-height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">600</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">text-align</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">center</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">div</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nt">img</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">max-height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">600</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">max-width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The idea behind the styling was to make the image stand out by using a black background, while making sure that the height of the image stayed a maximum of 600 px. In the future, I'd like this to be an adjustable parameter... or maybe not. We'll see.</p>
<h1 id="packaging-for-distribution">Packaging for Distribution</h1><p>This is one of the places where I've had a number of spectacular failures in the past, particularly because Python's packaging documentation is, in my opinion, out of line with the Zen of Python's philosophy of "there should be preferably one and only one way of doing things". I think what's missing from the official documentation is clear-cut examples for packaging Python packages, modules, and command-line programs, and examples of where they mix. If I get a chance in the future, I might contribute that.</p>

<p>Before we go on, please ignore my version numbering system. It's essentially the current date and time... While I know semantic versioning and the likes, for this single project, I decided to go simple and not worry about more complex stuff.</p>
<p>There's a few key stuff I learned here.</p>
<p>Firstly, the big highlight: making my package command-line accessible.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">entry_points</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;console_scripts&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;imgdisplay=imgdisplay.imgdisplay:start_server&#39;</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What this is saying is "map the <code>start_server()</code> function to the command <code>imgdisplay</code>". That creates the <code>imgdisplay</code> magic command that runs the app, because the entirety of the execution logic is contained in that function.</p>
<p>Secondly, including static data:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">package_data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;static&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;imgdisplay/static/*&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;templates&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;imgdisplay/templates/*&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
<span class="n">include_package_data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">,</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is <strong>very, very important</strong> for running the Flask app. The <code>static</code> and <code>templates</code> folders are default folders that Flask automatically looks for. These have to be packaged and distributed together in order for the app to work properly.</p>
<h2 id="building-distribution">Building Distribution</h2><p>To build the distribution at the command line, according to <a href="http://www.plankandwhittle.com/packaging-a-flask-web-app/">Plank &amp; Whittle's</a> website, there are two options for Python packages: a binary file, which contains only Python code, and a source distribution, which contains Python code + other files packaged in. Flask apps can only be distributed as a source distribution, so binary distributions are out of luck. I made the mistake of uploading a binary distribution to PyPI, and that cost me hours of debugging to get out of it, which I finally did. So here's the "correct" set of commands needed to avoid this headache:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> /path/to/project
$ <span class="c1"># execute the following line only if dist/ exists and there&#39;s stuff inside</span>
$ rm dist/*
$ <span class="c1"># the following command builds the source distribution</span>
$ python setup.py sdist
$ <span class="c1"># the following command uploads the package to PyPI!!!!!!!!</span>
$ twine upload dist/*
$ <span class="c1"># you will be prompted for username &amp; password to PyPI</span>
$ <span class="c1"># remove stuff under dist/* to keep it clean for updates.</span>
$ rm dist/*
</pre></div>
<p>At all costs, <strong>do not run</strong> <code>python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel</code>. This works for other pure Python packages, but not for Flask apps that are bundled with static files.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1><p>With that, that was it! Through this project, I was able to learn more about the insides of Python packaging &amp; distribution, making my Python tools accessible through the command line, developing web &amp; cross-platform interfaces, and working with really popular frameworks (Flask, click, pywebview). Big learning journey, only made possible because of some time taken off to let my mind wander away from other real work.</p>
<p>Do I see this fitting in with my current work? Yep, absolutely. There's some times in research where nothing beats building a prototype of a final product that I'm envisioning, for example, the front-end to a</p>
<p>I'd love to get feedback on how it could be improved, but more importantly, contributions are really welcome! Please be kind in feedback, I'm still a relative newbie with web development, so keeping things positive would help keep things encouraging. Hope you enjoyed the post!</p>
