  <p>I have been developing network visualization implementations for Python, mostly because I needed them. I also believe in open source principles, that broadly useful and applicable code should be made freely available with their implementations made transparent. Based on these principles, I have released Python implementations of <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/Circos">circos</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/hiveplot">hive plots</a>, with a ton of help from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-zabilansky-95390b3b">Justin Zabilansky</a> (MIT, now AeroFarms) and <a href="http://jonchar.net">Jon Charest</a> (MGH, who, by the way, is an aspiring data scientist).</p>
<p>At <a href="http://scipy2016.scipy.org">SciPy 2016</a>, I had the opportunity to chat with our conference co-chair, <a href="http://aric.hagberg.org">Aric Hagberg</a>, who also happens to be the lead maintainer of the <a href="https://networkx.github.io">NetworkX package</a>. Specifically, I asked about contributing circos and hive plots into NetworkX. From our discussion, and from discussing with Jon, we have this idea to create an <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz"><code>nxviz</code></a> package that provides a consistent API for creating network visualizations. Really excited about this! I also roped in a brilliant 1st-year UW undergrad <a href="http://nelsonliu.me/index.html">Nelson Liu</a>, who also has some network visualizations that he’d like to implement for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). (No pressure, of course!)</p>
<p>Looking forward to developing this "rational" network visualization package!</p>

  <p>I use networks as part of my research, and visualization is a very important part of it. The problem with network visualizations is that most people default to node-link diagrams that end up looking like <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=network+visualization+hairball&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web">hairballs</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if we put some thought into visualizing networks rationally, we can get aesthetic, beautiful and simultaneously informative network visualizations that are much more appealing than hairballs. My time at <a href="http://scipy2016.scipy.org">SciPy 2016</a>, hearing the keynote by <a href="http://www.physics.calpoly.edu/faculty/bgranger">Brian Granger</a> about <a href="https://github.com/ellisonbg/altair">Altair</a>, and talking with <a href="http://aric.hagberg.org">Aric Hagberg</a>, has given me a ton of inspiration on how rational network visualizations can be done right.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be drawn “rationally”? I think it means following the principles of good data visualization - in which size, shape, location, colour and transparency are all used to convey meaning. As applied to network visualizations, the key is in placing and styling the nodes in some “rational” or “logical” fashion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spatial location (i.e. <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates) follows some regular organization (e.g. in a shape, or along lines), based on grouping or ordering.</li>
<li>Node colour follows some grouping, or ordering, or scaling. (Note - it is in that order - colour doesn’t work well for scale.)</li>
<li>Highlights, such as borders, can be used to accentuate nodes of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates for each node are computed, drawing edges is a much easier matter. Meaning can be attached to edges by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Filtering out edges that are unnecessary to display.</li>
<li>Adjusting line thickness to convey quantitative data.</li>
<li>Colouring lines to convey grouping of edges.</li>
<li>Highlights, such as using different line styles, thickness, or colour (as long as they are not used to convey other things), to accentuate edges of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, it may be better to show panels of subsets of the graph, rather than the whole graph itself, rather than shove the entire graph into one visualization. This is because extracting subsets of edges (and even just the relevant nodes) and displaying them on separate plots reduces visual clutter.</p>
<p>Hive Plots and Circos Plots are two examples of network visualizations done well, for they conform to these principles. They will both be available in the <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz"><code>nxviz</code></a> package that I will be co-developing, and I hope to use <code>nxviz</code> to highlight these details. I think there are other creative layouts as well, such as Arc Plots and Parallel Line Plots that can help us gain a more rational view of the structure of our network data.</p>
<p>From an API design perspective, the “grammar”-based API that specifies how things are coloured makes a ton of sense. For example, a HivePlot API may look as such:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">HivePlot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nodes</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">edges</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">node_groupby</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">groupby_key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">node_colorby</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">colorby_key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">edge_colorby</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">colorby_key</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">h</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">draw</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The user need not specify how individual nodes are coloured, as long as the <code>groupby_key</code> is present in the metadata. Likewise for node colours and edge colours.</p>
<p>Implementing this into <code>nxviz</code>, I think, is going to be a really challenging, fun and rewarding thing to do!</p>

  <p>Like <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2016/">PyCon 2016</a>, I ended up doing the Hallway Track at <a href="http://www.scipy2016.scipy.org">SciPy 2016</a>, which really meant hanging out in the hallway, talking with people, fixing code bugs, and writing. Oh, and not to mention, running/jogging/walking on the treadmill to burn off all the food they've fed us. Part of the rationale for doing the hallway track is because all of the talks will be online (they are already going up!) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gf37zYZMw6OqGFRPjB1jCy6">YouTube</a>, so I can selectively listen to the ones that I'm most interested in later. (We also have a grant deadline to meet today, so I've needed time to work on that.)</p>
<p>I re-connected with <a href="http://www.hugobowneanderson.com">Hugo Bowne-Anderson</a>, who works at <a href="https://www.datacamp.com">DataCamp</a> as a curriculum engineer. He was previously in the field of quantitative physical biology, and now works to bring data science skills to the workforce. A really funny giant Ozzylander (Australian)! We are working together on bringing some of my network analysis material into DataCamp - exciting stuff!</p>
<p>I got a chance to talk with <a href="http://aric.hagberg.org">Aric Hagberg</a>, who is the lead developer for <a href="https://networkx.github.io">NetworkX</a>. He shared with me some stories of how they got NetworkX started, and his thoughts on the future of NetworkX as a package. I definitely learned a lot from him on the software engineering side.</p>
<p>I had a chance to meet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-wilson-a26510b6">Greg Wilson</a>, finally, in person! He led our software and data carpentry instructor training. He always has interesting stories to tell.</p>
<p>I re-connected with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolwilling">Carol Willing</a>, and a few other MIT-related people (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noelle-held-537a7aab">Noelle</a> and <a href="https://halexand.github.io">Harriet</a>). Carol is always telling me to stay out of trouble, just as a grandmother-like figure would :P. She also wrote a very encouraging comment for me at the end of the tutorial session that I led on Network Analysis. Such a grandma-type!</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun time chatting with my roommate, <a href="http://oswco.com">Tom Brander</a>, who has a ton of industry experience and was once an employee of Citibank. He is a master networker, and connected me with tons of people at the conference.</p>
<p>I also met some of the financial aid recipients, such as Sartaj, Aman, and AMiT. The reason Amit spells his name that way is because Amit is a commonly-used names in India, so that’s his way of differentiation. I also re-connected with <a href="http://hargup.in">Harsh Gupta</a>, whom I met last year - he has leveraged his experiences with <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html">SymPy</a> and <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">GSoC</a> to do some really cool other things! I also connected with Nelson Liu (UW), who showed me quite a bit of the ropes behind Pokemon Go on the first night of SciPy. (Yes, I was the one responsible for that channel.) Turns out it wasn’t all games and play only; Chris Niemara put together <code>bokehmongo</code> - a Pokemon implementation that used good’ol physics code and Bokeh plots! (SoftEng nerds out there - do not read it as <code>bokeh</code> and <code>mongo</code>!)</p>
<p>During the sprints, I had a chance to sprint with the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org">Bokeh</a> team! I learned much more about the internals of Bokeh than I could have just reading the developer documentation alone (side note: it’s a <em>complicated</em> library of code, but <em>very</em> well organized). <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanvdv">Bryan Van de Ven</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/birdsarah">Sarah Bird</a> were also amazingly helpful during the sprint as well, just as <a href="https://github.com/jenshnielsen">Jens Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tacaswell">Thomas Caswell</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WeatherGod">Benjamin Root</a> helped me during last year’s sprint with the <a href="http://matplotlib.org"><code>matplotlib</code></a> team. I recommended that Noelle, also a graduate student at MIT, sprint with the MPL team. In my opinion, they have a very mature and easy-to-follow workflow coupled with a dozen low-hanging fixes that a newcomer to open source can help with.</p>
<p>In parallel, with SciPy, there was another scientific conference ongoing somewhere else, and I was seeing the “new post-doc positions available!” (re-)tweets flooding my feed. I personally dislike those tweets because I think post-docs ought to be paid at least double the current NIH pay rate. SciPy conferences don’t have those tweets happening, and I think it is for the betterment of the community that way.</p>
<p>All-in-all, SciPy 2016 was yet another really fun community conference! (Apologies if I forgot the names of other people; there's just too many to remember!) Looking forward to helping out with next year’s conference!</p>

  <p>And we’re done! Two days of fun, intense, and hopefully mind-expanding tutorials at SciPy 2016.</p>
<p>I led two sessions of my network analysis workshop. Originally, I was only going to lead one session, and I thought I’d get a niche crowd and a small class. However, it turned out that there was much more interest than expected, and it turned out there was a waitlist, so the tutorial committee chairs (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentjustin">Justin Vincent</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WeatherGod">Ben Root</a>) opened up another slot for the tutorial. This was mostly unexpected because I tended to consider network analysis and network science to be a niche topic in the scientific world.</p>
<p>On day 1, the crowd was approximately 60+ people, and on day 2, the class was only 20 people. On both days, it was a fun time sharing the content that I’d prepared with everybody there. I think the nature of a small class made it logistically much easier to get through all 6 notebooks. The statistical inference notebook, however, went over the heads of many people today; I think statistical thinking is something that needs to be inculcated over time. I am thinking of leaving statistical thinking out for next year (which might be the final year that I do this tutorial, but I’ll see).</p>
<p>The feedback from the tutorial crowd was very encouraging, very thoughtful as well! I personally scanned them all and read each one. I spent a bit of time then uploading the positive ones to my personal site, and fiddling around to get a carousel working. They can be found <a href="../../../testimonials/network-analysis-made-simple/">here</a>.</p>

  <!-- Put post body -->
  <p>On Thursday, 7 July 2016, I attended a workshop on effective mentoring by <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/bruce-birren">Bruce Birren</a> at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org">Broad Institute</a>. Bruce is an experienced scientist at the Broad, and he has had decades of experience mentoring many trainee scientists. To my (pleasant) surprise, he knew who I was (by name)! (I don't remember introducing myself to him before yesterday.)</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway that I think Bruce was trying to convey was the idea that <strong>mentees can, and should, actively take a role in managing the mentor-mentee relationship</strong>. The reality for mentees is that mentors either care or don’t care about them (the latter are rare); if they care, they likely don’t have enough time to devote to each and every one of their mentees. Rare is the mentor who can consistently provide one-on-one mentorship to their mentee. Therefore, the reality for most mentees is that they have to actively take charge of the relationship in order to make the relationship mutually beneficial. (FWIW, I’m not endorsing this scenario as most ideal, but merely describing it as “the way things are”.)</p>
<p>An interesting concept that Bruce conveyed was the definition of mentorship as being: “A symbiotic relationship aimed at advancing careers and career satisfaction for both the mentor and the mentee.” Yes, that is right, it is a mutually-beneficial relationship, not a one-way relationship. This actually empowers the mentee to figure out how to deliver value to the mentor. It does make sense, if we think about it - if a mentee is known to be successful and acknowledges help from his/her mentor, the mentor’s reputation is enhanced as well. A rising tide floats all ships.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, because of the mentor’s time constraints, the mentee has the biggest onus of preparing for every meeting with the mentor. I’m in this boat right now, as I prepare for meetings with my committee members and (potential) future collaborators. From experience, this means making a few adjustments to how we present our updates (which I think are reasonable ones to make).</p>
<p>Firstly, I think we have to assume that our mentor does not remember what’s happened since the last meeting. This means crafting the updates in such a way that helps them connect what you’re saying to some “bigger picture” - whether that means scientific goals, professional goals, or personal goals.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have to adjust the way we present the material such that our mentor is most receptive to it. The example Bruce gave was that of himself (which mirrors myself as well). He calls himself a “whiteboard person” - someone who thinks aloud and visually on the board; I use the whiteboard to anchor transient thoughts and get a feel for the big picture. If Bruce were my mentor, it would be ineffective for me to simply talk with him in a room without a whiteboard. The onus is on the mentee to learn how to communicate in a fashion that helps the mentor understand where the mentee is. (Of course, it helps that the mentor adjusts and takes notes accordingly too, but we have to approach the relationship without this expectation.)</p>
<p>Thirdly, the onus is on us as mentees to help our mentors focus how they can help us the most effectively. This means determining the agenda and communicating to them expectations for each meeting, and asking them what they expect of us as well. Going up to them and asking for “advice in general” isn’t effective. Going to them with a set of specific questions/goals that we think they can help us with is.  For example, I may set the agenda for a meeting with my mentor, with the expected goals of determining date ranges for the next committee meeting and defence dates, expectations for what to prepare for the next committee meeting, and ask for letters of support for the next career move. Mentors don’t have extra-sensory perception; we need to communicate with them how we think they can help us.</p>
<p>Specifically for scientists, it is important that individuals learn how to progressively become independent researchers. By independent, I define it as “being able to, out of one’s own capacity, (1) identify, (2) articulate, (3) defend the importance of, and (4) generate and defend the principled interpretation of data that provides a path towards solving a problem.” This has to be learned over time, and each person comes in with aspects of each part at different maturity levels. The challenge for the mentee, then, is to identify where s/he is weak in each of these, and ask for specific help from a variety of mentors towards working on one’s weak spots.</p>
<p>Okay, to reiterate, the biggest thing that Bruce conveyed to us was that mentees can and should actively manage the mentor-mentee relationship. To borrow a quote that Bruce shared from the Harvard Business Review, “Some superiors spell out their expectations very explicitly. But most do not. Ultimately the burden falls on the subordinate to discover what the boss’ expectations are.” (Gabarro and Kotter, 1980, <a href="https://hbr.org/2005/01/managing-your-boss/ar/1">HBR</a>) Likewise for mentor-mentee relationships.</p>
