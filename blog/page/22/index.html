  <p>I will be at SciPy 2016 this year, to deliver a workshop titled <a href="http://scipy2016.scipy.org/ehome/146062/332960/">"Network Science and Statistics: Applications and Fundamentals"</a>. A huge thanks to those who have registered!</p>
<p>The materials are already available on <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple">GitHub</a>, but will be updated within the coming weeks as I incorporate feedback from this year's PyCon 2016 and ODSC East 2016 participants.</p>
<p>Looking forward to being in Austin and meeting with everybody!</p>

  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>For scientists who are looking to take their Python code to the next level, options are abound. I’ve decided to put down in writing a short summary of what I’ve learned so far.</p>
<p>Disclaimers:</p>
<ul>
<li>the “best use cases” part comes from personal experience, not from referenced literature, and is by necessity going to be of limited scope.</li>
<li>your mileage… ahem, <em>speed increases</em> may vary. (yada yada yada)</li>
<li><strong>your algorithm complexity matters more than these tools below.</strong></li>
<li>learn how to profile your code, and then profile, profile, and profile before you optimize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, here’s the shortlist, in no particular order:</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="pypy">PyPy</h4><p>Great if you have only pure Python code, have to deal with things in Python objects, and import other modules that are only pure Python.</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Agent-based simulations, re-implementing random draws from a variety of distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> Speedups can be massive; in my hands anywhere between 8-100X. PyPy is a really simple drop-in replacement for the regular CPython that we’re all used to.</p>
<p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Have to download an alternate Python interpreter. I have yet to successfully use PyPy as my <code>jupyter</code> backend. Need to tweak environment variables to get <code>pip</code> to install packages/modules such that they’re accessible by <code>pypy</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="numpy-and-scipy"><code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code></h4><p>Great if you’re writing things that are, by nature, arrays of stuff, with operations that can be vectorized across all rows (or columns).</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Matrix math.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> are well-supported, community-favoured, thoroughly tested and all-round great standard scientific computing libraries to use. Easily installable via <code>conda</code>!</p>
<p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Very few, except that Python overhead is incurred every time a function is called, so one has to get used to avoid calling same function over and over in a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="numba"><code>numba</code></h4><p>Exciting stuff from Continuum Analytics developer team! Basically a JIT compiler (not unlike PyPy) but for numeric code instead. Can speed up <code>numpy</code> code, according to their claims.</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Matrix math and numeric code.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> Uses the CPython interpreter that we’re all used to. Speedups gained by simply adding a function decorator. Also easily installable by <code>conda</code>!</p>
<p><strong>Downsides:</strong> Doesn’t work with Python objects very well right now.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="cython">Cython</h4><p>Only for the brave of heart! A simple way to continue writing Python-ish code that then gets compiled to C, which is blazing fast.</p>
<p><strong>My use cases:</strong> Not sure yet. It is good, don’t get me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Upsides:</strong> I’ve done a head-to-head <code>numpy</code> vs. Cython version  of what I’m trying to do. 25X speed-up. And again, easily installable by <code>conda</code>. (It’s probably clear by now that I’m a Continuum Analytics fanboi.)</p>
<p><strong>Downside:</strong> Have to learn a new-ish language with some intricacies in order to really get the massive speed-ups. I initially could only write Cython code that didn’t break, but would end up with little speed-up (1-1.5X max). Going faster needed a lot more tweaking, probably lots more practice.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="bonus">Bonus!</h3><p>How did I pick up each of these? It was some mixture of following online tutorials, trying to modify examples myself, reading Stack Overflow, and coding with another advanced person who was willing to teach me stuff. I found the last one to be the most effective of them all, as the back-and-forth is great for learning.</p>
<p>Hope this post helps you decide what to try next for speeding up your code!</p>

  </p>
  <p>This year at PyCon 2016, totally inspired by <a href="http://www.davidbaumgold.com">DB</a>, I did the "hallway track".</p>
<p>What's the hallway track, you say? Basically, it means spending the majority of my time in the hallways of the conference, and doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Taking time to do your own thing: I rebuilt my personal website on a cheaper host and with a static site generator.</li>
<li>Talking with other people and connecting with them. I learned a ton about what other people do.</li>
<li>Catching up with familiar faces and strengthening acquaintance connections. I caught up with <a href="https://www.continuum.io/people/travis-oliphant">Travis</a> (Continuum Analytics CEO) and his team (<a href="http://chdoig.github.io">Christine</a> & <a href="http://matthewrocklin.com">Matt</a>), <a href="http://www.allendowney.com">Allen</a> (whom I helped TA his tutorial), <a href="https://twitter.com/vishnubob">Giles</a> (who helped me kickstart half my thesis) and <a href="http://www.bu.edu/csmet/fulltimefaculty/parttimefaculty/">en zyme</a> (the professor who continues to connect me with interesting people).</li>
</ol>
<p>I did an extreme thing, which was that I missed every single talk, including the keynotes, and didn't go for anything. In retrospect, I wouldn't recommend doing that, for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a 3rd year PyCon attendee, it still makes sense to have heard a few talks so that there's a common topic to talk about with newcomer attendees. A few times I was caught off guard not knowing what else to talk about.</li>
<li>For newcomers, I'd still recommend listening in on the talks. They're immensely educational! Like <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com">Ned Batchelder</a>, I have come to believe that everybody has a talk inside of them as well; listening in on how other speakers did their thing can give you inspiration to talk about how you did your thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having attended a number of conferences over the years, PyCon remains my favourite community conference, with SciPy a very, very close second. The difference is just that I learn a broader range of useful things at PyCon than at SciPy; otherwise, the people are amazing in both conferences. Hope to be in PDX again at PyCon 2017!</p>

  <p>Having learned more about the web dev/software engineering world over the past few years, I have become more curious about static sites. Speed and security were my main concerns; WordPress has given me issues in the past. I heard quite a bit about the use of static site generators, such as Pelican, Jekyll and such, but they were relatively more effort to work with than I'm used to.</p>
<p>This year, I heard about <a href="https://www.getlektor.com">Lektor</a>, which is a static site generator written in Python, written by the guys who write <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> as well, but I couldn't figure out how to use it properly. On day 2 here, I finally had a lesson from <a href="https://www.davidbaumgold.com">David Baumgold</a> on how Lektor works, and I was sold. So I decided to migrate over! I fired up my own <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> droplet, bought a new test domain, and made this new site.</p>
<p>Overall, it definitely runs faster than my old site. DO runs on SSDs, and the site is static which eliminates the need to query a database. Looking forward to continuing to use it! Slowly, I will be migrating older posts into here.</p>

  </p>
  <p>In our Bible Study small group, I have found through empirical observation that when the group size is large (&gt;5 people) and homogeneous (all guys/girls, all believers, all Bible study leaders), Bible study tends to be either too flat or too chatty, too boring or too distracted, and all-round just not beneficial for learning. On the other hand, when the group is small (3-5 people) and diverse (guys & girls, baptized + seekers together, counsellors spread out), learning takes place. (Outside of Bible study groups, I find this to be true anyways, and doing it this way prevents the formation of exclusivist insider-groups.)</p>
<p>It’s challenging to do this division by hand though, as there can always be subtle biases that creep in. So I decided to use a bit of information theory and Python to do this division in an unbiased fashion. The result? My own hand-crafted <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/small-group">small group</a> web app that keeps track of group members in a larger group, and uses a simple genetic algorithm for shuffling them into optimally diverse groups of people.</p>
<p>The data categories used are simple, and by no means do I use this to “categorize” people for privileges, they’re only used for assigning responsibilities in the group. We use gender (M, F), faith status (baptized, believer, seeker, unknown), and role (facilitator, counsellor, none). The algorithm essentially works as such:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the number of small groups to keep the group size within 3-5 people.</li>
<li>Randomly distribute individuals across the groups, by first distributing the facilitators, and then everybody else.</li>
<li>Until max number of tries has been reached:<ol>
<li><strong>Scoring Step:</strong> Compute Shannon entropy within each group, and sum up Shannon entropy scores across each category, across all groups.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal Step:</strong> Propose to swap two random individuals.</li>
<li><strong>Comparison Step:</strong> Compute new Shannon entropy score under the swap. If it does not decrease Shannon entropy and passes the “exclusion criteria”, accept swap. Else, pass.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Return all the small groups.</li>
</ol>
<p>A note on the comparison step: In other algorithms I’ve seen, acceptance is conditional if and only if the score (Shannon entropy) is increased, but in this case, not decreasing is ‘good enough’. I have my engineer hat on.</p>
<p>I added a way to include “exclusion criteria”, such as the scenario where it would be inappropriate to put two people in the same group, for example, where there is a simmering conflict in the midst, or where the relationship between the two could be distracting to learning. Right now, that functionality is baked into the back-end, but I am designing an implementation to make it accessible through the front-end.</p>
<p>The web app is written in Python, and uses only two packages: <code>tinydb</code> (<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tinydb">link</a>) and <code>Flask</code> (<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">link</a>). Front-end uses HTML with <code>Jinja2</code> (<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/">link</a>) templating and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">Bootstrap</a> CSS. I wrote the GUI using <code>Flask</code> because I didn’t need fancy stuff that Django offered, and was simple enough for me to run locally. I opted for <code>tindyb</code> only because it was an even simpler, lightweight version of a database (as a JSON) file, and was sufficient for what I needed too. Of course, I’m quite sure this can be re-implemented in Django/SQLite, and made infinitely more fancy :). The code for <code>small-group</code> is available on <a href="http://github.com/ericmjl/small-group">GitHub</a>, along with instructions for how to use it. Enjoy!</p>
