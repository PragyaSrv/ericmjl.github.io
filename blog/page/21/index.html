  <p>It's been about 2 months since starting up with the <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/protein-systematic-characterization">GitHub lab notebooks</a> for a project that I'm coordinating. Here's some thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Firstly, version control systems are really powerful as a backup system! Already more than once I've been able to <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/protein-systematic-characterization/pull/33">salvage work</a> that was accidentally over-written.</p>
<p>Secondly, GitHub offers some pretty neat settings that ensure the integrity of a lab notebook and provide for peer review of lab experimental reports. I have my GitHub repo's master branch on lockdown, meaning all new changes to it have to be pulled in from other forks, and the submitter cannot be the reviewer that approves it. With my UROP student now added as a collaborator on the repository, basically we have to approve each other's work before being allowed to merge into master, and can add requests for minor additions that will make the lab experimental report easier to follow. It's akin to signing off on a lab notebook, basically, meaning that the person responsible for the experiment and the person responsible for checking the experiment are both provisioned and tracked.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we've already used the fact that the lab notebook is completely public and online, and therefore completely available 24/7, to <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/protein-systematic-characterization/pull/30">check for mistakes</a> made in previous reports or as-of-yet non-replicable results. Mistakes will always be made, and some results will turn out to be non-replicable, so it's okay to make them once or twice (but not repeatedly, of course); the more important part is that it's publicly recorded, and discussed either in the merging portion or as an issue.</p>
<p>Because everything is digitally recorded, and everything is also distributed, in the event that, say, GitHub goes down, there's at least multiple backups on local computers and local computer backups to restore snapshots of the work. (We will lose all of the commenting history, of course, if GH goes down.)</p>
<p>Because our lab reports use Markdown files with descriptive file names, it's actually possible to write scripts that automatically produce indexes of all experiments conducted for easier browsing. I'm looking forward to seeing what else can be built on top of the file system with version control.</p>

  <p>I just saw an awesome pair of blog posts by <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/09/the-care-and-feeding-of-your-scientist-collaborator/">Roger Peng</a> and <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/08/the-care-and-feeding-of-the-biostatistician/">Elizabeth Matsui</a>, detailing how scientists and statisticians can work together more effectively. Highly recommended read! In the duration of my PhD, I've been one of two resident statisticians for our research group (it's a relative expertise thing - I know enough to be dangerous), and so the article really resonated with me. Here's my summary.</p>
<p>Firstly, both ought to take the time to learn each others' core concepts and methods. For the experimentalist, learn some basics about distributions of a random variable and what 'inference' really means beyond p=0.05 (FYI, p&lt;0.05 â‰  inference). For the statistician, take the time to learn some of the basic (bio)chemistry, the experimental setup, and how difficult it is to collect data.</p>
<p>Secondly, have some patience! Both sides will need some time to learn the ins-and-outs of the data collection, analysis, inference reasoning process and the likes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, involve the statistician earlier on in a collaboration, not towards the end. The statistician can help make sense of the scientific question in terms of the data collected, and thus can help with the experimental design.</p>
<p>Fourthly, and this point really matters for PIs, give the statistician sufficient support, particularly on the grants. 1% effort doesn't cut it. Even 5% is on the low side of reasonable. Something more like 10-20% effort makes more sense.</p>
<p>Finally, a statistician's primary goal should be to advance the science through the proper deployment of statistics. A scientist's primary goal is to help identify the most important problems of a (sub-(sub-))field to solve. Together as collaborators, they can find the right experimental design towards this pair of goals.</p>
<p>I'll add in a pointer of my own here - as a statistician, it really shouldn't be about helping your scientist collaborator find "what's significant", which (ahem) often means p&lt;0.05. My view of inference has, over the past year, turned Bayesian, and I'm now increasingly confident in the notion that Bayesian-style reasoning is not only the most natural way to reason through the data, it's actually the right way to do inference on scientific data. Given priors, some perhaps uninformative, about the state of nature, our goal in science is to compute the probability distribution over some parameters of nature.</p>

  <p>I've been thinking back on my experience being on the SciPy 2016 Financial Aid committee, having myself received a full scholarship to attend SciPy 2015.</p>
<p>I had a chance to talk with two of the SciPy scholarship recipients. They belonged to a trio that we really wanted to fund, but because of budget constraints and a desire to help more excellent applicants attend the conference, we had to drop one (the more experienced guy) from the list. It still gets to me sometimes, having to be part of the decision-makers that makes these "constrained decisions". I can't imagine, for example, making life-and-death decisions instead.</p>
<p>I later learned that the trio contacted their hosting organization, and using some leftover money that the other two were entitled to + some other leftover funds elsewhere, they were able to help the experienced guy come in to the conference. I'm not really good with words for emotions, so the only word that most accurately describes my feelings towards this is "wow". Relative to what I observe in modern North America, where I keep hearing about the constant fights for rights, this was a huge dose of self-sacrifice instead, and I was really moved.</p>
<p>On another note, I also learned that SciPy has one of the most generous financial aid packages available in terms of total dollars awarded. I hope this can continue; having money to disburse to purposefully bring people together is an investment in people that will pay off many fold non-monetary dividends elsewhere.</p>

  <p>The same data, different visualizations.</p>
<p>Here's the box plot version:</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/9/27/boxplot-or-violin-plot/accuracy-boxplot.png" alt="Data plotted using Seaborn&#39;s box plot."></p>
<p>And here's the violin plot version.</p>
<p><img src="../../../blog/2016/9/27/boxplot-or-violin-plot/accuracy-violinplot.png" alt="Data plotted using Seaborn&#39;s violin plot."></p>
<p>Which is more appropriate, and why?</p>
<p>I think the Box Plot is more suited for clearly delineating ranges: (min, max), (IQR), and medians, whereas the Violin Plot is more suited for visualizing the distribution of data, including the possibility of bi-/multi-modality.</p>
