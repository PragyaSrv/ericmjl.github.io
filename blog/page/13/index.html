  <p>Jupyter notebooks that are filled with complex analyses can get unwieldy. Refactoring repeated code out into functions placed in modules should be standard practice, but from the sampling of Jupyter notebooks I've seen, I don't think this is standard practice.</p>
<p>When should code be refactored? As soon as we start copying/pasting it! Making sure I have self-contained functions ensures that lingering state in my notebook doesn't cause unexpected behaviour. (Side note: learning the "functional" programming mindset can be very useful here!)</p>
<p>But won't this slow down my pace? Isn't it faster to just copy and paste the code, and tweak what I need? Yes, but a small speed hit is going to be traded for a massive bump in rigour. Just today, I saw the effects of "lingering state" in my notebooks causing my plots to display different things before and after refactoring. It's not a good sign for any analysis if this happens.</p>
<p>In short, refactor your code.</p>

  <p>I recently had a few PRs merged into the PyMC3 codebase. Really happy about it, and just like my previous bug fix, I thought I'd share a bit about how those PRs came about.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/2789">first PR</a> was an update to the docs on when to specify precision and when to specify standard deviation. They're related, so only one has to be specified, but I sometimes am sloppy when reading the docs and didn't pick up on that. Thus, I added a few lines to make sure this was crystal clear to sloppy readers like me.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/2799">next PR</a> was an update to the Mixture model docs, in which I added an example of the new API for specifying components of mixture models. It previously wasn't clear how to do this, as there were no examples provided, so I put in a documentation PR specifying examples.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pull/2804">final PR</a> was a patch to the Weibull distribution. I wanted to play around with trying mixture Weibulls at work, but mixture Weibulls wouldn't work because it didn't have a mode specified. I checked on Wikipedia, and found that Weibull's mode is conditional on the value of its parameters, and thus put in a PR to make this happen. <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/bayesian-analysis-recipes/blob/master/notebooks/mixture-model.ipynb">Trying it out on some simulated/toy data</a>, it worked! Thus, the devs allowed it to be merged.</p>
<p>A few lessons I've learned along the way:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Docs are an awesome place to start.</strong> In fact, I made a few formatting mistakes in my first and second PRs that gave an opportunity for another guy to fix! Nothing is too small to be made as a contribution. FWIW, my first contribution to open source software were documentation fixes for <code>matplotlib</code>, and that was a superb learning journey!</p>
<p><strong>(2) Friendly maintainers are crucial.</strong> The PyMC dev team can basically be described as, "generally super nice!" From the online and in-person interactions I've had with them, there's little in the way of egos, they're always learning, always being generally helpful. If they weren't that way, I very likely would have second thoughts trying putting in a PR there.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Open source lets me fix bugs I find.</strong> This lets me work at the pace that I need to, without having to wait for commercial vendors to provide update patches. If the patch that I find turns out to be useful for others, then the work I did can possibly save a ton of people's time as well. Win-win scenario!</p>

  <p>I was locked out of my work computer due to password reasons. (It's not human error - something about corporate management tools locked me out. Okay, well, that's human error too.) That said, I inadvertently gained a full two hours of offline time on Monday.</p>
<p>Those two hours turned out to be pretty productive. I spent some time sketching out my work projects, trying to make better sense of how the project could fit in a disease area researcher's workflow, and figuring out derivative analyses that could enhance the value to them. This was something I probably wouldn't be able to accomplish if I had the regular distractions of my computer nearby.</p>
<p>Seems like Cal Newport's "digital distraction de-cluttering" is a good thing to do. I must do more of it.</p>

  <p>The following thought hit my mind just last night.</p>
<p>Bayesian inference requires the computation of uncertainty. Computing that uncertainty is computationally expensive compared to simply computing point estimates/summary statistics. But when exactly is uncertainty useful, and more importantly, actionable? That's something I've not really appreciated in the past. It's probably not productive to be dogmatic about always computing uncertainty if that uncertainty is not actionable.</p>

  <p>During my week attending PyData NYC 2017, which was effectively a mini-mini-sabbatical from work, I got a chance to try out Visual Studio Code. Part of it was curiosity, having seen so many PyData participants using it; part of it was because of Steve Dowell, a core CPython contributor who works at Microsoft, who mentioned about the Python-friendly tools they added into VSCode.</p>
<p>I think VSCode is representative of a new Microsoft.</p>
<p>But first, let me describe what using it is like.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2><p>First off, the UI is beautiful. It's impossible to repeat enough how important the UI is. With minimal configuration, I made it basically match Atom's UI, which I had grown used to. It has an integrated terminal, and the colours are... wow. That shade of green, blue and red are amazing, ever just so slightly muted compared to the Terminal or iTerm. The background shade of black matches well with the rest of VSCode, and the colour scheme is changeable to match that of Atom's. The design feels... just right. Wow!</p>
<h2 id="git-integration">Git Integration</h2><p>Secondly, the integration with Git rivals Atom; in fact, there's a one-click "sync" button! It also has nice <code>git commit -am</code> analog where I can add and commit all of the files simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="intellisense">Intellisense</h2><p>Thirdly, IntelliSense is just amazing! I like how I can use it to look up a function signature just by mousing over the function name.</p>
<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2><p>Finally, it’s fully open source and back able, in the same vein as Atom, minus the bloat that comes from building on top of electron. Impressive stuff!</p>
<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other Thoughts</h2><p>Now, on the new Microsoft.</p>
<p>Only at the recent PyData NYC did I learn that Microsoft has hired almost half of the core CPython developers! Not only that, they are encouraged to continue their contributions into the CPython code base. In my view, that’s a pretty awesome development! It means the Python programming language will continue to have a strong corporate backing while also enjoying community support. Its a sign of a healthy ecosystem, IMO, and also a sign of Microsoft’s support for Open Source Software!</p>
<p>I’m more and more impressed by what Microsoft is doing for the Open Source community. I’m hoping they’ll continue up with this!!</p>
