  </p>
  <p>I recently got around to hacking a system for managing my <code>conda</code> environments better. Previously, my coding projects mostly relied on one master environment (with exceptions, e.g. <code>bokeh</code> development, or my Network Analysis Made Simple tutorial), but conflicts started cropping up. Thus, I decided to separate out my environments. However, keeping track of which environments go with which projects began getting tedious.</p>
<p>I thus decided to automate some of the steps involved in maintaining environments, and keep everything centrally managed so my brain doesn't overload. It involves a bit of GitHub and a bit of bash scripting, but altogether gives a ton of flexibility and control over keeping my environments updated.</p>
<p>I start by keeping a central repository of <code>conda</code> environment YAML specifications. Mine is kept <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/conda-envs">here</a>. Each YAML specification includes just the minimum set of packages that I need; <code>conda</code> manages the dependencies.</p>
<p>For example, my environment specification for Bayesian statistical analyses looks as such:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">name</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">bayesian</span>  <span class="c1"># for Bayesian analysis</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">channels</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="kt">!!python/tuple</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">conda-forge</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">defaults</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">ericmjl</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">dependencies</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">python=3.6</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">matplotlib</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">numpy</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pandas</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">scipy</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">seaborn</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">pymc3</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">jupyter</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">jupyterlab</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, I've not pinned specific versions here, because I like to keep up with the latest stable releases. However, if version pinning is desired, it's totally possible to pin specific packages to particular versions, using the same syntax as I did for <code>python=3.6</code>.</p>
<p>In each project repository, I have an <code>update_env.sh</code> script, that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericmjl/conda-envs/master/lektor.yml -O environment.yml
conda env update -f environment.yml
</pre></div>
<p>The key idea here is that I download only the relevant YAML file, export it as a generic <code>environment.yml</code> file, and then run the <code>conda env update</code> command on it to keep the environment up-to-date.</p>
<p>Now, here's the magic. I hacked Christine Doig's <code>conda-auto-env</code> script  to execute <code>update_env.sh</code>, and then auto-activate the environment.</p>
<p>If my environment needs change, I can always update the environment YAML spec file (e.g. <code>lektor.yml</code>, or <code>bayesian.yml</code>) in the central repository, and use that to automatically update individual project environments.</p>

  <p>It is done! I have defended my doctoral thesis, supervised by Prof. Jonathan A. Runstadler, advised by Prof. Mark Bathe and Prof. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, conducted as a student in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's been an amazingly fun journey, and I'll be updating this space with a more detailed account of the thesis defence process. Stay tuned!</p>

<center><b>Identification of Reassortant Influenza Viruses at Scale - Algorithm and Applications</b></center><center>by</center><center>Eric Ma</center><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Reassortment is a reticulate evolutionary process that results in genome shuffling; the most prominent virus known to reassort is the influenza A virus. Methods to identify reassortant influenza viruses do not scale well beyond hundreds of isolates at a time, because they rely on phylogenetic reconstruction, a computationally expensive method. This thus hampers our ability to test systematically whether reassortment is associated with host switching events. In this thesis, I use phylogenetic heuristics to develop a new reassortment detection algorithm capable of finding reassortant viruses in tens of thousands viral isolates. Together with colleagues, we then use the algorithm to test whether reassortment events are over-represented in host switching events and whether reassortment is an alternative 'transmission strategy' for viral persistence.</p>

  </p>
  <p>It's my final week before defending my thesis.</p>
<p>The thesis has been submitted to my committee, and my slides, as usual, are being made until the last minute.</p>
<p>I've had a number of conversations with a number of people, both in person and via email, and a few recurring themes start showing up.</p>
<p><strong>New Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Scientists are artists in some senses, computational scientists particularly, and I think I'm ready for a new challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Jobs</strong></p>
<p>People invariably ask, "What's next?" I tell them that I've ruled out a "traditional post-doc", and that  I'm not wedded to the academic ivory tower, I'm wedded to my wife, and so if the timing doesn't work out for independent research fellows positions, I'm jumping out. Well, as things turned out, yes, I'm jumping out, and I'm looking forward to this new journey!</p>
<p><strong>Data Science</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago, I was pretty deflated with the job search. Interviews were slow to come, and I began to think that all the "hype" around life science DS was just that - hype - and that the demand wasn't there. A few months later, I'm proven wrong, and quite happily proven wrong too.</p>
<p><strong>Insight</strong></p>
<p>I signed the Insight Health Data Science Fellows contract, to join them for 7 weeks in the summer. Many were perplexed - isn't Insight all about getting a job? Not really. For me, it's about meeting like-minded individuals and being able to network with them.</p>
<p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>
<p>I've done interviews at a few places now, and the response has been very positive. No offers yet, but nonetheless these are all places where I can foresee myself being valued for what I can contribute, while having fun working with colleagues on new problems.</p>
<p><strong>Feelings</strong></p>
<p>The defence, at this point, has this magical effect of inducing anxiety at times, and feeling like "just another thing to do" at other times. I'm not sure what to make of this.</p>
<p><strong>Thesis</strong></p>
<p>My thesis, as it turns out, is super duper short. The departmental average range is on the order of 100-400 pages. Mine stands at about 80, including references, with double-spaced text, and sometimes having one figure/table on one page. I think I've broken some departmental records here...</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>
<p>Someone asked, "Who is your defence audience going to be?" I've decided it'll be for my committee, who have supported my intellectual journey through infectious disease, computation, and data science. In some ways it's my "final performance" during grad school, a way of saluting their support.</p>
<hr>
<p>As the clock winds down, I'm reminded of that phrase from Philippians:</p>
<blockquote><p>... forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead... (<a href="https://www.bible.com/111/PHP.3.13-14">Philippians 3:13-14</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laurels, yes, I have acquired indeed. MIT is no slouchy place to graduate from, and it's a privilege to have this degree. I've had the privilege and opportunity to remake my skillset while having fun along the way. But it's no time to rest on my laurels. It's time to start serving the world through the skillset I have been given. Onward!</p>

  </p>
  <p>As I wrap up grad school, one thought recurrently comes to mind: as we grow older, do we intrinsically lose mental agility, nimbleness and ability to learn? Or is it because of external factors that cause one to become less adventurous, less curious, and hence, less able to learn new things?</p>
<p>I find myself having flashes of fear crop up as I observe those who are older than me. They are stuck in between a hard place and a rock. Their skills may be on the wane (in terms of demand). They want to learn new things, but have to continue doing the old things to keep the ship afloat. I can imagine, it feels tough to be in that kind of position! Without the safety net to take a risk and learn something new, they may be stuck in a dying trade. Will I have to face the same fate? Is it avoidable, or even perhaps, surmountable?</p>
<p>The even harder part is staying intellectually nimble, and not being stuck in particular ways of thought. Is that an intrinsic property of aging, or not?</p>
<p>Just some questions I've been pondering...</p>
