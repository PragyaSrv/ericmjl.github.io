    <h2>Using Bokeh in FluForecaster</h2>

  <p>Author: Eric J. Ma, Insight Health Data Science Fellow (Boston 2017b)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In this blog post, I will show how Bokeh featured in my Insight project, FluForecaster.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>As a Health Data Fellow at Insight, we spend about 3 weeks executing on a data project, which we demo at companies that are hiring. I built <a href="https://fluforecaster.herokuapp.com/">FluForecaster</a>, which was a project aimed at forecasting influenza sequence evolution using deep learning.</p>
<p>My choice of project was strategically aligned with my goals on a few levels. Firstly, I wanted to make sure my project showcased deep learning, as it's currently one of the hottest skills to have. Secondly, I had components of the code base written in separate Jupyter notebooks prior to Insight, meaning, I could execute on it quickly within the three weeks we had. Thirdly, I had intended to join Insight primarily with the goal of networking with the Insight community, and that basically meant 'being a blessing' to others on their journey too - if I could execute fast and well on my own stuff, then there'd be time to be a team player with other Fellows in the session, and help them get their projects across the finish line.</p>
<p>Each of us had to demo a "final product". Initially, I was thinking about a "forecasting dashboard", but one of our program directors, Ivan, suggested that I include more background information. As such, I decided to make the dashboard an interactive blog post instead. Thus, with FluForecaster being a web-first project, I finally had a project in which I could use Bokeh as part of the front-end.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Bokeh</strong></p>
<p>Bokeh was used mainly for displaying three data panels in the browser. Firstly, I wanted to show how flu vaccine efficacy rarely crossed the 60% threshold over the years. Secondly, I wanted to show a breakdown of the number of sequences collected per year (as used in my dataset). Thirdly, I wanted to show a visual display of influenza evolution.</p>
<p>For yearly vaccine effectiveness, it was essentially a line and scatter chart, with the Y-axis constrained between 0 and 100%. I added a hover tooltip to enable my readers to see the exact value of vaccine effectiveness as measured by the US CDC.</p>
<p>To show the number of sequences per year in the dataset, the same kind of chart was deployed.</p>
<p>Bokeh magic became really evident later when I wanted to show sequence evolution in 3 dimensions. Because 3D charts are generally a poor choice for a flat screen, I opted to show pairs of dimensions at a time. A nice side-effect of this is that because my <code>ColumnDataSource</code> was shared amongst each of the three pairs of coordinates, panning and selection was automatically linked for free.</p>
<p><strong>Usage Pros and Cons</strong></p>
<p>Bokeh's API is very powerful, in that it supplies many plotting primitive objects (glyphs, particularly), and that makes it a big plus for users who are experienced with the library, who are creating complex interactive charts.</p>
<p>Most of my fellow Fellows at Insight ended up using the <code>bokeh.plotting</code> interface, and I did too. I think the <code>bokeh.plotting</code> interface provides the best balance between ease-of-use and flexibility. If you take a look at the code <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/flu-sequence-predictor/blob/master/utils/webplots.py#L15">here</a>, you'll notice that there's often a bit of boilerplate that gets repeated with variation, such as in the configuration of custom hover tools. I think this is the tradeoff we make for configurability... or I might just be not writing code most efficiently. :)</p>
<p>There were times where I was tempted to just use the <code>bkcharts</code>' declarative interface instead. It's a lot more easy to use. However, I did have some time on hand, and wanted to get familiar with the <code>bokeh.plotting</code> interface, because there's a possibility that I might want to make wrappers for other visualizations that can lend themselves to a declarative API.</p>
<p><strong>Embedding Visualizations</strong></p>
<p>I built my interactive blog post using a combination of Flask, hand-crafted HTML, Bootstrap CSS & JS, and Bokeh - which took care of the bulk of visuals. I drew static figures using Illustrator.</p>
<p>Embedding the necessary Bokeh components wasn't difficult. Very good documentation is available on the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html">Bokeh docs</a>. The key insight that I had learned was that I could have the <code>components</code> passed into my Flask app functions' <code>return</code> statements, and embed them using Jinja2 templating syntax. An example can be found <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/flu-sequence-predictor/blob/master/templates/index.html#L81">here</a>. Basically, <code>components</code> returns a <code>div</code> and a <code>js</code> object, which are essentially just strings. To embed them in the templates, we use the syntax <code>{{ div|safe }}</code> and <code>{{ js|safe }}</code>. That <code>|safe</code> is very important: it tells the Jinja2 templating engine that it's safe to render those pieces of Javascript and HTML.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Through the project, I became a lot more familiar with the Bokeh plotting library. Now I feel a bit torn! I've contributed to both the Bokeh and <code>matplotlib</code> projects, and I love them both! I've also come to deeply respect the lead developers of both projects, having interacted with them many times. If I were to make a comment on "where to use what" based on my experience, it'd probably still be the conservative view of "<code>matplotlib</code> for papers, <code>bokeh</code> for the web"... but I'm sure that will be outdated soon. Who knows how the Python plotting landscape will evolve - it's exciting times ahead, and at least for now, I'm happy for the experience driving a dataviz project with Bokeh!</p>
