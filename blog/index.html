  <p>Those who think “AI will solve medicine” are delusional.
I say this as a practitioner of machine learning in drug discovery and development.</p>
<p>First things first, “AI” is an overused term.
We should stop using it, especially in medicinal research.</p>
<p>Now, my thoughts are more sanguine.
The real value proposition of machine learning models in drug development
is to navigate chemical, sequence, pathway, and knowledge space
faster and smarter than we might otherwise do so
without machine learning methods.
It’s a modeling tool, and nothing more than that.
It’s a tool for helping the human collective make better decisions than without it,
but it’s also a double-edged sword.
We can use the tool and then constrain our thinking because we have that tool,
because we want to continue using that tool.
Or we can use the tool to our advantage
and liberate our mind to think of other things.</p>
<p>This thought was sparked off by an email that I was on at work.
A molecule was approved for <em>continued investigation</em> (not even “go for safety trials”!),
and 63 people were on that email.
Imagine the number of people
who are involved in getting a molecule past all research-phase checkpoints
<em>and</em> all 3 clinical trial checkpoints.
<em>Hint: Many people are involved.</em></p>
<p>As I combed through the names on that email,
the number of machine learners was vastly outnumbered by the number of colleagues
who toiled daily at the bench,
wrangling with even more uncertainty than that we have at our computers.
We machine learners work in service of them,
delivering insights and prioritized directions,
just as they toil to generate the data that our data-hungry models need.
It’s a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>What do all of those 63 people work on?</p>
<p>Some make the molecules.
Others design the assays to test the molecules in.
Yet others design the assays to find the target to then develop the assay for.
It’s many layers of human creativity in the loop.
I can’t automate the entirety of their work with my software tools, but I can augment them.
I mean, yeah, I can find a new potential target,
but ultimately it's a molecular biologist
who develops the assay, especially if that assay has never existed before.</p>
<p>There are others who professionally manage the progress of the project.
There’s sufficient complexity at the bench
and in the silicon chips
that we can’t each keep track of the big picture.
Someone has to do that, and keep everybody focused.</p>
<p>And then there’s the handful of us who deal with numbers and mainly just numbers.
Yes, it’s a handful.
I counted them on my fingers.
We do have an outsized impact compared to our numbers,
but that’s because we can get computers to do our repetitive work for us.
At the bench, robots are harder to work with.
Having been at the bench before and failing badly at it,
I can very much empathize with how tedious the work is.
It’s expensive to collect that data,
so the onus is on us computation types to get help navigate “data space” more smartly.</p>

  <p>I found this nifty tool for caching the results of long-running functions: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cachier/"><code>cachier</code></a>. This is useful when we’re building, say, Python applications for which quick interactions are necessary, or for caching the results of a long database query.</p>
<p>How do we use it? Basically it’s nothing more than a decorator!</p>
<p>Let’s imagine I have a long-running function as below.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">long_running_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># stuff happens</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Turns out, if you have a need to cache the result in a lightweight fashion, you can simply add <code>cachier</code>:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">cachier</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">cachier</span>

<span class="nd">@cachier</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">long_running_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># stuff happens</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The result is stored in your home directory, so the cache is accessible to you.</p>
<p>One nice thing <code>cachier</code> also offers is the ability to set a time duration after which the cache goes stale. This can be useful in situations where you know that you need to refresh the cache, such as a database query that may go stale because of new data added into it. This is done by specifying the <code>stale_after</code> keyword argument:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">cachier</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">cachier</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">timedelta</span>

<span class="c1"># Re-cache result after 1 week.</span>
<span class="nd">@cachier</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stale_after</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">timedelta</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weeks</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">long_running_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># stuff happens</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you need to reset the cache manually, you can always do:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">long_running_function</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clear_cache</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There are other advanced features that <code>cachier</code> provides, and so I’d encourage you to go and take a look at it!</p>

  <p>Recording this for myself, since I did it once and probably don't have the brain bandwidth to remember this through repetition.</p>
<p>I have known how to run a "public" Jupyter server (password-protected, naturally), but one thing I've struggled with was getting HTTPS working.</p>
<p>Turns out, the <code>letsencrypt</code> instructions aren't that bad on Jupyter's docs. I just was ignorant in the past, and didn't know enough about Linux to get this working right.</p>
<p>The key here is creating a <code>letsencrypt</code> certificate, and making sure file permissions are set correctly.</p>
<p>First off, go to the <a href="https://certbot.eff.org">Certbot page</a>. Select the type of website you're running and operating system. For Jupyter, I chose "None of the Above" and "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic)" (even though I'm technically on Ubuntu 19). (Here's a <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntubionic-other">shortcut link</a> to the instructions if you're in the same situation.)</p>
<p>On my system (Ubuntu-based), I used the following commands to install <code>certbot</code>:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Add repository</span>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update

<span class="c1"># Install certbot</span>
sudo apt-get install certbot

<span class="c1"># Run certbot</span>
sudo certbot certonly --standalone
</pre></div>
<p>Follow the instructions. <code>certbot</code> will install into a protected directory. In my case, it was <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/&lt;mywebsite&gt;/</code>.</p>
<p>Here, a problem will show up. That directory above is not accessible by a Jupyter server run under a user other than <code>root</code>. But a desired property of running Jupyter servers is that we don't have to use <code>sudo</code> to run it. How can we solve this? Basically, by making sure that the certificate is readable by a non-<code>root</code> user.</p>
<p>What I did, then, was to copy the files that were created by <code>certbot</code> into a location under my home directory. For security by obscurity, I'm naturally not revealing its identity. Then, I changed ownership of those files to my username:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">pwd</span>  <span class="c1"># you should be in the directory where the certbot-created files are located</span>
su -
chown &lt;myusername&gt; *.pem  <span class="c1"># changes ownership of those files</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, I went into my Jupyter config (<code>~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py</code>, this is well-known), and edited the two lines that specified the "certfile" and the "keyfile":</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NotebookApp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">certfile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mycert.pem&#39;</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NotebookApp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">keyfile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mykey.key&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If this helps you, leave me a note in the comments below. :)</p>

  <p>Do people learn better by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generalizing from one example explained well, or by</li>
<li>Having multiple case studies that highlight the same point?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think both are needed, but I am also torn sometimes by whether it’s more effective to communicate using the former or the latter.</p>
<p>Case in point: In teaching Bayesian statistics, the coin flip is a particular case of the Beta-Binomial model. However, the Beta-Binomial model can be taken from its most elementary form (estimation on one group) through to its most sophisticated form (hierarchically estimating <code>p</code>).</p>
<p>I guess if the goal is to show how broadly applicable a given model class (i.e. the beta-binomial model) is, a teacher would elect to jump between multiple examples that are apparently distinct. However, if the goal is build depth (i.e. going from single group to multiple group estimation), sticking with one example (e.g. of baseball players, classically) would be the better strategy.</p>
<p>Both are needed, just at different times, I think. Thinking through this example, I think, gives me a first-principles way of deciding which approach to go for.</p>

  <p>At work, we don’t have a service that has the simplicity of Heroku. Part of it is that we’re still behind what’s available for free in my FOSS life (both commercial and FOSS offerings), and cybersecurity tends to be a gatekeeper against adoption of new things, which is a reality I have to face at work.</p>
<p>BUT! I am unwilling to simply bow down to this secnario. “There’s got to be a better way.”</p>
<p>What does that mean? It means if we want a Heroku-like thing internally, we have to hack together workarounds.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/">Dokku</a>!</p>
<p>What is it? It’s a FOSS implementation of the functionality that Heroku provides. It’s only slightly more involved than Heroku, and gives us a really nice taste of what’s possible with Heroku.</p>
<p>Dokku claims to be the “smallest PaaS implementation you’ve ever seen”, and I fully believe it. The maintainers have done a wonderful thing, making the installation process as simple and clean as possible. I’ve successfully installed it on a bare DigitalOcean droplet and on my home Linux tower. I’ve also successfully installed it in EC2 instances at work, albeit needing a few minor modifications to the script they provide.</p>
<h2 id="why-would-i-want-to-use-dokku?">Why would I want to use Dokku?</h2><p>Taking Dokku on my DigitalOcean droplet as an example, what it effectively provides is a self-hosted Heroku.</p>
<p>This means you can get 95% of the convenience that Heroku offers, except done in-house. This can be handy if you’ve got cybersecurity standing in the way of awesome convenience, or if finance isn’t willing to shell out the moolah.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-we-do-with-dokku?">What can we do with Dokku?</h2><p>Here’s a few neat things that we can do.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can provision a database to run on the same compute node as the app, and then link them together. If your compute node is “beefy” enough (RAM/CPU/storage-wise) to handle both the database and the app (and I mean, I’m confident that most disposable apps aren’t going to be at a large scale), then it can be pretty handy, because it means we save on latency.</li>
<li>We can deploy apps using either Heroku buildpacks (which look for Procfiles) or using Dockerfiles. Docker containers can be easier to maintain if we have a large and/or complex <code>conda</code> environment, in my opinion, as we can reuse the existing environment spec, but Procfiles are much nicer for smaller projects. This fits with the paradigm of “declaring what you need”, rather than “programming what you need”. </li>
<li>Because Dokku is managing everything through isolated Docker containers, we can actually enter into a Docker container and muck around to debug, without worrying about breaking the broader system. I realize now how neat it is to have containerization, but without a unified front-end interface to manage the containers, networking interfaces, and environment variables, it’s tough to keep everything straight. Dokku provides that front-end interface.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-are-you-deploying-right-now?">What are you deploying right now?</h2><p>On my DigitalOcean box, which I use for personal projects, I have deployed both the “Getting Started” Ruby app that Heroku provides as well as a <a href="../blog/2019/9/7/dokku-building-an-internal-heroku-at-work/minimal-panel.ericmjl.com">minimal app</a> showcasing a minimal dashboard using <a href="../blog/2019/9/7/dokku-building-an-internal-heroku-at-work/panel.pyviz.org">Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The easy part was getting Dokku up and running. The hard part, though, was getting URLs and DNSs right. It took some debugging to get that work correctly.</p>
<p>In particular, Dokku uses a concept called virtual hosts (<code>VHOSTS</code>) to route from the Dokku host to individual containers. For example, to get <code>minimal-panel.ericmjl.com</code> up and running correctly, I had to ensure that <code>*.ericmjl.com</code> was routed to my DigitalOcean box.</p>
<h2 id="how-have-we-used-this-at-work?">How have we used this at work?</h2><p>At work, I just finished prototyping the use of Dokku on EC2. In particular, I was able to deploy both Dockerfile-based and Procfile-based projects. Once again, getting a domain was the most troublesome part of this project; spinning up an EC2 instance and configuring it became easy using a simple Bash script which we executed on each test spin-up machine.</p>
<h2 id="what-changes-between-heroku-and-dokku?">What changes between Heroku and Dokku?</h2><p>The biggest thing I found is that I need to at least have SSH-access to the compute box that is running Dokku. This is because what we would usually configure on Heroku’s web interface (e.g. environment variables), we would instead configure using <code>dokku</code>’s command-line interface via SSH. Hence, not being afraid of the CLI is important.</p>
<h2 id="whats-your-verdict?">What’s your verdict?</h2><p>If you know Heroku, Dokku gets you 95% of the convenience you’re used to, plus quite a bit more flexibility to customize it to your own compute environment.</p>
