  </p>
  <p>A few years on after trying out PyPy for the first time and wrestling with it, I still find it to be pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Now that PyPy officially supports <code>numpy</code>, I'm going to profile a few simple statistical simulation tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing the mean of a number of random number draws.</li>
<li>Simulating many coin flips</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll profile each of the tasks four ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure Python implementation running from the CPython and PyPy interpreters</li>
<li><code>numpy</code> implementation running from the CPython and PyPy interpreters.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how do PyPy and CPython fare? Let's show the results up front first.</p>
<p><a href="../blog/2017/10/11/pypy-impressive/profile.png"><img src="../blog/2017/10/11/pypy-impressive/profile-sm.png" alt="Profiling results."></a></p>
<p>Click on the image to view a higher resolution chart. The raw recorded measurements can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QB1hF7Z8SGYjvll8sYCjVYEYAgzL4pjqGt1dbO6B2Co/edit?usp=sharing">on Google Sheets</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a description of what's happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>(top-left): PyPy is approx. 10X faster than CPython at computing the mean of 10 million random numbers.</li>
<li>(top-right): When both are running <code>numpy</code>, the speed is identical.</li>
<li>(bottom-left): When simulating coin flips, PyPy with a custom <code>binomial()</code> function is about 3X faster than CPython.</li>
<li>(bottom-right): When using <code>numpy</code> instead, there is a bottleneck, and PyPy fails badly compared to CPython.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty clear that when PyPy is dealing with "pure" data (i.e. not having to pass data between Python and C), PyPy runs very, very fast, and, at least in the scenarios tested here, it performs faster than the CPython interpreter. This is consistent with my previous observations, and probably explains why PyPy is very good for code that is very repetitive; the JIT tracer really speeds things up.</p>
<p>That last plot (bottom-right) is a big curiosity. Using the code below, I measured the random number generation is actually just as fast as it should be using CPython, but that PyPy failed badly when I was passing in a <code>numpy</code> array to the <code>Counter()</code> object (from the standard library). I'm not sure what is happening behind-the-scenes, but I have reached out to the PyPy developers to ask what's going on, and will update this post at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I heard back from the PyPy devs <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2680/slow-speed-going-from-numpy-data-structure">on BitBucket</a>, and this is indeed explainable by data transfer between the C-to-PyPy interface. It's probably parallel to the latency that arises from transferring data between the CPU and GPU, or between compute nodes.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean? It means that for pure Python code, PyPy can be a very powerful way to accelerate your code. One example I can imagine is agent-based simulations using Python objects. Another example that comes to mind is running a web server that only ever deals with strings, floats and JSONs (in contrast to matrix-heavy scientific computing).</p>
<p>Now, for those who are curious, here's the source code for the <strong>pure Python implementation of the mean of random numbers</strong>.</p>

  </p>
  <p>I'm seriously looking forward to PyData NYC this year -- there's a great lineup of talks that I'm particularly looking forward to hearing! The theme for my set of must-see talks this year is "Bayesian machine learning" - there's much for me to learn!</p>
<p>The first is by my fellow Boston Bayesian <strong><a href="https://colindcarroll.com/">Colin Caroll</a></strong> with his talk titled <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/12/">Two views on regression with PyMC3 and scikit-learn</a>. Colin is a mathematician at heart, even though he does software engineering for living now, and I can't wait to hear about regularization strategies!</p>
<p>The second is by <strong><a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/6/">Nicole Carlson</a></strong>, with her talk titled <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/24/">Turning PyMC3 into scikit-learn</a>. Nicole's talk is of interest to me because I've implemented models in PyMC3 before, and now would like to know how to make them reusable!</p>
<p>The third talk is by <strong><a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/118/">Chaya Stern</a></strong>, with her talk titled <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/53/">Bayesian inference in computational chemistry</a>. Super relevant to my work at Novartis!</p>
<p>The fourth is by my fellow Boston Pythonista <strong><a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/34/">Joe Jevnik</a></strong>, who will be speaking on the first day about his journey into deep learning on some really cool time-series data. He works at Quantopian, BUT the spoiler here is that his talk is NOT about financial data! (I've heard his talk outline already.)</p>
<p>The fifth is a tutorial by <strong><a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/29/">Jacob Schrieber</a></strong>, with his talk titled <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/30/">pomegranate: fast and flexible probabilistic modeling in python</a>. <code>pomegranate</code>'s API models after the <code>scikit-learn</code>'s API; with the API being the user-facing interface, and <code>scikit-learn</code> being the <em>de facto</em> go-to library for machine learning, I'd be interested to see how much more <code>pomegranate</code> adds to the ecosystem, particularly w.r.t. Bayesian models.</p>
<p>There are a swathe of other good talks that I'm expecting to be able to catch online later on. <strong><a href="https://matthewrocklin.com/">Matt Rocklin</a></strong>, who is the lead developer of Dask, has done a ton of work on speeding Python up through parallelism. His talk will be on <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/22/">the use of Cython & Dask to speed up GeoPandas</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <strong><a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/speaker/profile/80/">Thomas Caswell</a></strong>, one of the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/"><code>matplotlib</code></a> lead devs who helped guide my first foray into open source contributions, is giving a tutorial on <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/3/">developing interactive figures in matplotlib</a>. Highly recommended if you're into the visualization world!</p>
<p>Finally, the always-interesting, always entertaining <strong><a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/25/">en zyme</a></strong> will be speaking on an <a href="https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/25/">interesting topic</a>.</p>
<p>Looking forward to being at the conference, and meeting old and new friends there!</p>

    <h2><a href="../blog/2017/10/10/recursive-programming-and-dags/">Recursive Programming and DAGs</a></h2>

  </p>
  <p>Over the past few days, I've found myself using recursive programming to implement a "model specification" system with inheritance for deep learning. The goal here is to enable reproducible computational experiments for particular deep learning hyperparameter sets. Reproducibility is something I learned from the Software/Data Carpentry initiative, thus I wanted to ensure that my own work was reproducible, even if it's not (because of corporate reasons) open-able, because it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>So, how do these "model spec" files work? I call them "experiment profiles", and they specify a bunch of things: <strong>model architecture</strong>, <strong>training parameters</strong>, and <strong>data tasks</strong>. These experiment profiles are stored in YAML files on disk. A profile essentially looks like the following (dummy examples provided, naturally):</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Name: default.yaml</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">parent</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">null</span>

</pre></div>
<p>In this YAML file, the key-value pairs essentially match the API of the tooling I've built on top of Keras' API to make myself more productive. (From the example, it should be clear that we're dealing with only feed-forward neural networks and nothing else more complicated.) The key here (pun unintended) is that I have a <code>parent</code> key-value pair that specifies another experiment profile that I can inherit from.</p>
<p>Let's call the above example <code>default.yaml</code>. Let's say I want to run another computational experiment that uses the <code>adam</code> optimizer instead of plain vanilla <code>sgd</code>. Instead of re-specifying the entire YAML file, by implementing an inheritance scheme, I can re-specify only the optimizer and optimizer_options.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Name: adam.yaml</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">parent</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;default.yaml&quot;</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">training_parameters</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">optimizer</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;adam&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's say I find out that 20 epochs (inherited from <code>default.yaml</code>) is too much for Adam - after all, Adam is one of the most efficient gradient descent algorithms out there - and I want to change it to 3 epochs instead. I can do the following:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Name: adam-3.yaml</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">parent</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;adam.yaml&quot;</span>
<span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">training_parameters</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
    <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">optimizer_options</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span>
        <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">n_epochs</span><span class="p p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">3</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Okay, so specifying YAML files with inheritance is all good, but how do I ensure that I get the entire parameter set out correctly, without writing verbose code? This is where the power of recursive programming comes in. Using recursion, I can solve this problem with <strong>a single function that calls itself on one condition, and returns a result on another condition</strong>. That's a recursive function in its essence.</p>
<p>The core of this problem is traversing the inheritance path, from <code>adam-3.yaml</code> to <code>adam.yaml</code> to <code>default.yaml</code>. Once I have the inheritance path specified, loading the YAML files as a dictionary becomes the easy part.</p>
<p>How would this look like in code? Let's take a look at an implementation.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">yaml</span> 

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">inheritance_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yaml_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">    :param str yaml_file: The path to the yaml file of interest.</span>
<span class="sd">    :param list path: A list specifying the existing inheritance path. First</span>
<span class="sd">        entry is the file of interest, and parents are recursively appended to</span>
<span class="sd">        the end of the list.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yaml_file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;r+&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">yaml</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;parent&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">path</span>
        <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;parent&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">inheritance_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;parent&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The most important part of the function is in the <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> block. If I have reached the "root" of the inheritance path, (that is, I have hit <code>default.yaml</code> which has no parent), then I return the <code>path</code> traversed. Otherwise, I return into the <code>inheritance_path</code> function call again, but with an updated <code>path</code> list, and a different <code>yaml_file</code> to read. It's a bit like doing a <code>while</code> loop, but in my opinion, a bit more elegant aesthetically.</p>
<p>Once I've gotten the path list, I can finally load the parameters using a single function that calls on <code>inheritance_path</code>.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">load_params</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">yaml_file</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>
<p>This is the equivalent of traversing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), or in some special cases, a tree data structure, but in a way where we don't have to know the entire tree structure ahead of time. The goal is to reach the root from any node:</p>
<pre><code>root
    |- A
        |- B
        |- C
            |- D
            |- E
    |- F
        |- G
        |- H
        |- I 
            |- J
</code></pre>
<p>Also, because we only have one pointer in each YAML file to its parent, we have effectively created a "Linked List" that we can use to trace a path back to the "root" node, along the way collecting the information that we need together. By using this method of traversal, we only need to know the neighbors, and at some point (however long it takes), we will reach the root.</p>
<pre><code>D -&gt; C -&gt; A -&gt; root
E -&gt; C -&gt; A -&gt; root
J -&gt; I -&gt; F -&gt; root
</code></pre>
<p>If you were wondering why linked lists, trees and other data structures might be useful as a data scientist, I hope this illustrates on productive example!</p>

  <p>You might have encountered a piece of software asking you for permission to modify your <code>PATH</code> variable, or another program's installation instructions cryptically telling you that you have to "set your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variable correctly".</p>
<p>As a data scientist, you might encounter other environment variable issues when interacting with your compute stack (particularly if you don't have full control over it, like I do). This post is meant to demystify what an environment variable is, and how it gets used in a data science context.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-environment-variable?">What Is An Environment Variable?</h2><p>First off, let me explain what an environment variable is, by going in-depth into the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. I'd encourage you to execute the commands here inside your bash terminal (with appropriate modifications -- read the text to figure out what I'm doing!).</p>
<p>When you log into your computer system, say, your local computer’s terminal or your remote server via SSH, your bash interpreter needs to know where to look for particular programs, such as <code>nano</code> (the text editor), or <code>git</code> (your version control software), or your Python executable. This is controlled by your PATH variable. It specifies the paths to folders where your executable programs are found.</p>
<p>By historical convention, command line programs, such as <code>nano</code>, <code>which</code>, and <code>top</code>, are found in the directory <code>/usr/bin</code>. (By historical convention, the <code>/bin</code> folder is for software binaries, which is why they are named <code>/bin</code>.) These are the ones that are bundled with your operating system, and as such, need special permissions to upgrade.</p>
<p>Try it out in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ which which
/usr/bin/which
$ which top
/usr/bin/top
</code></pre>
<p>Other programs are installed (for whatever reason) into <code>/bin</code> instead. <code>ls</code> is one example:</p>
<pre><code>$ which ls
/bin/ls
</code></pre>
<p>Yet other programs might be installed in other special directories:</p>
<pre><code>$ which nano
/usr/local/bin/nano
</code></pre>
<p>How does your Bash terminal figure out where to go to look for stuff? It uses the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. It looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>The most important thing to remember about the <code>PATH</code> variable is that it is "colon-delimited". That is, each directory path is separated by the next using a "colon" (<code>:</code>) character. The order in which your bash terminal is looking for programs goes from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/usr/bin</code></li>
<li><code>/bin</code></li>
<li><code>/usr/local/bin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>On my particular computer, when I type in <code>ls</code>, my bash interpreter will look inside the <code>/usr/bin</code> directory first. It'll find that <code>ls</code> doesn't exist in <code>/usr/bin</code>, and so it'll move to the next directory, <code>/bin</code>. Since my <code>ls</code> exists under <code>/bin</code>, it'll execute the <code>ls</code> program from there.</p>
<p>You can see, then, that this is simultaneously super flexible for customizing your compute environment, yet also potentially super frustrating if a program modified your <code>PATH</code> variable without you knowing.</p>
<p>Wait, you can actually modify your <code>PATH</code> variable? Yep, and there's a few ways to do this.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-modify-the-path-variable">How To Modify the <code>PATH</code> variable</h2><h3 id="using-a-bash-session">Using a Bash Session</h3><p>The first way is transient, or temporary, and only occurs for your particular bash session. You can make a folder have higher priority than the existing paths by "pre-pending" it to the <code>PATH</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code>$ export PATH=/path/to/my/folder:$PATH
$ echo $PATH
/path/to/my/folder:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Or I can make it have a lower priority than existing paths by "appending" it to the <code>PATH</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code>$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/my/folder
$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/path/to/my/folder
</code></pre>
<p>The reason this is temporary is because I only export it during my current bash session.</p>
<h3 id="bashrc-or-.bash_profile-file"><code>bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code> File</h3><p>If I wanted to make my changes somewhat more permanent, then I would include inside my <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code> file. (I recommend using the <code>.bashrc</code> file.) The <code>.bashrc</code>/<code>.bash_profile</code> file lives inside your home directory (your <code>$HOME</code> environment variable specifies this), and is a file that your bash interpreter will execute first load. It will execute all of the commands inside there. This means, you can change your PATH variable by simply putting inside your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>...other stuff above...
# Make /path/to/folder have higher priority
export PATH=/path/to/folder:$PATH

# Make /path/to/other/folder have lower priority
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/folder
...other stuff below...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-science-and-the-path-environment-variable">Data Science and the <code>PATH</code> environment variable</h2><p>Now, <strong>how is this relevant to data scientists?</strong> Well, if you're a data scientist, chances are that you use Python, and that your Python interpreter comes from the Anaconda Python distribution (a seriously awesome thing, go get it!). What the Anaconda Python installer does is prioritize the <code>/path/to/anaconda/bin</code> folder in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. You might have other Python interpreters installed on your system (that is, Apple ships its own). However, this <code>PATH</code> modification ensures that each time you type <code>python</code> into your Bash terminal, you execute the Python interpreter shipped with the Anaconda Python distribution. In my case, after installing the Anaconda Python distribution, my <code>PATH</code> looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Even better, what conda environments do is prepend the path to the conda environment binaries folder while the environment is activated. For example, with my blog, I keep it in an environment named <code>lektor</code>. Thus...</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
$ which python
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin/python
$ source activate lektor
$ echo $PATH
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/envs/lektor/bin:/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
$ which python
/Users/ericmjl/anaconda/envs/lektor/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the bash terminal now preferentially picks the Python inside the higher-priority <code>lektor</code> environment.</p>
<p>If you've gotten to this point, then you'll hopefully realize there's a few important concepts listed here. Let's recap them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PATH</code> is an environment variable stored as a plain text string used by the bash interpreter to figure out where to find executable programs.</li>
<li><code>PATH</code> is colon-delimited; higher priority directories are to the left of the string, while lower priority directories are to the right of the string.</li>
<li><code>PATH</code> can be modified by prepending or appending directories to the environment variable. It can be done transiently inside a bash session by running the <code>export</code> command at the command prompt, or it can be done permanently across bash sessions by adding an <code>export</code> line inside your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_profile</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-environment-variables-of-interest">Other Environment Variables of Interest</h2><p>Now, what other environment variables might a data scientist encounter? These are a sampling of them that you might see, and might have to fix, especially in contexts where your system administrators are off on vacation (or taking too long to respond).</p>
<p><strong>For general use</strong>, you'll definitely want to know where your <code>HOME</code> folder is -- on Linux systems, it's often <code>/home/username</code>, while on macOS systems, it's often <code>/Users/username</code>.  You can figure out what <code>HOME</code> is by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $HOME
/Users/ericmjl
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If you're a Python user</strong>, then the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is one variable that might be useful. It is used by the Python interpreter, and specifies where to find Python modules/packages.</p>
<p><strong>If you have to deal with C++ libraries</strong>, then knowing your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable is going to be very important. I'm not well-versed enough in this to espouse on it intelligently, so I would defer to <a href="http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html">this website</a> for more information on best practices for using the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>If you're working with Spark</strong>, then the <code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code> environment variable would be of interest. This essentially tells Spark which Python to use for both its driver and its workers; you can also set the <code>PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON</code> to be separate from the <code>PYSPARK_PYTHON</code> environment variable, if needed.</p>
<h3 id="hack-your-environment-variables">Hack Your Environment Variables</h3><p>This is where the most fun happens! Follow along for some stuff you might be able to do by hacking your environment variables.</p>
<p><strong>Hack #1: Enable access to PyPy.</strong> I occasionally keep up with the development of PyPy, but because PyPy is not yet the default Python interpreter, and is not yet <code>conda install</code>-able, I have to put it in its own <code>$HOME/pypy/bin</code> directory. To enable access to the PyPy interpreter, I have to make sure that my <code>/path/to/pypy</code> is present in the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, but at a lower priority than my regular CPython interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>Hack #2: Enable access to other language interpreters/compilers.</strong> This is analogous to PyPy. I once was trying out Lua's JIT interpreter to use Torch for deep learning, and needed to add a path to there in my <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Hack #3: Install Python packages to your home directory.</strong> On shared Linux compute systems that use the <code>modules</code>  system rather than <code>conda</code> environments, a <code>modulefile</code> that you load might be configured with a virtual environment that <em>you don't have permissions to modify</em>. If you need to install a Python package, you might want to <code>pip install --user my_pkg_name</code>. This will install it to <code>$HOME/.local/lib/python-[version]/site-packages/</code>. Ensuring that your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> includes <code>$HOME/.local/lib/python-[version]/site-packages</code> at a high enough priority is going to be important in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Hack 4: Debugging when things go wrong.</strong> In case something throws an error, or you have unexpected behaviour -- something I encountered before was my Python interpreter not being found correctly after loading all of my Linux modules -- then a way to debug is to temporarily set your PATH environment variable to some sensible "defaults" and sourcing that, effectively "resetting" your PATH variable, so that you can manually prepend/append while debugging.</p>
<p>To do this, place the following line inside a file named <code>.path_default</code>, inside your home directory:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=""  # resets PATH to an empty string.
export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH  # this is a sensible default; customize as needed.
</code></pre>
<p>After something goes wrong, you can reset your PATH environment variable by using the "source" command:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/some/complicated/path:/more/complicated/paths:/really/complicated/paths
$ source ~/.path_default
$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin
</code></pre>
<p>Note - you can also execute the exact same commands inside your bash session; the interactivity may also be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I hope you enjoyed this article, and that it'll give you a, ahem, path forward whenever you encounter these environment variables!</p>

  <p class="meta">

      <a href="https://twitter.com/ericmjl">Eric J. Ma</a>
    
    on 2017-10-03
  </p>
  <p>Ever since "going corporate", it's meant picking up more new productivity/coding habits. Here's a sampling of what I've learned.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Living by my calendar</strong></p>
<p>Basically, the "work calendar" defines everything about the day. I've had to make sure that if I am not going to be pencilled in for a meeting, I have to block out time on the calendar first.</p>
<p>Also, sending invites to people + rooms -- the latter being the newest habit I've had to pick up.</p>
<p>Finally, setting informative titles for calendar events - if I want to have coffee or lunch with X, I can't just write "Coffee with X" - it literally shows up as "Coffee with X" on X's calendar, which is super awkward, as if they're having coffee with themselves! Something more informative, like, "Eric <> X coffee" really helps the other person, who might be super busy and thus only glances at their calendar once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Flagging emails and applying rules</strong></p>
<p>Emails fly everywhere. It gets super overwhelming after a while.</p>
<p>If there's stuff that needs to be followed-up on, it stays in my Inbox until it's done. It also gets flagged, which automatically creates a Todo on my task list. (If this sounds like Outlook - yes, it's Outlook. On macOS. With no "email snoozing" feature...)</p>
<p><strong>(3) Hacking through legacy code and shared compute resources</strong></p>
<p>Working on a compute cluster with a code base that's built for legacy versions of programming languages is super frustrating! Thankfully I know enough about the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 to hack my way through.</p>
<p>Shared compute resources means using <code>modules</code>, but not everybody sets up <code>modules</code> with the same set of assumptions as others. Some create virtual environments inside a module, others append to <code>$PATH</code>, and getting the right combinations in a modular way is really tricky. It means I have some really painful one-off <code>$PATH</code> hacks to make stuff work. Documentation is paramount - without putting in docs, I'll never remember what I did...</p>
<p><strong>(4) Adapting to others' coding styles</strong></p>
<p>Not everybody is a Python programmer, and not everybody is a Pythonic programmer. The usual Python idioms that I'm used to (whether functional or object-oriented) sometimes get thrown out in favour of some other style (globals, anybody?), and I have to adapt to figure out what's going on. Thankfully my colleagues are open to me modifying their code, as long as I can demonstrate that the new version works fine, and I've been working hard to bring in Pythonic code style.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Performance reviews</strong></p>
<p>Gotta start getting used to this. I had a taste of it while volunteering as part of Tang Hall's student leadership, but now it's for real.</p>
