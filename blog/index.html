  <p>Finally, I have finished Judea Pearl's latest work "The Book of Why"! Having read it, I have come to appreciate how much work had to go on in order to formalize the very intuitions that we have for causal reasoning into essentially a modelling language.</p>
<p>"The Book of Why" is geared towards the layman reader. Thus, unlike a textbook, it does not contain "simplest complex examples" that a reader can walk through and do calculations by hand (or through simulation). Thankfully, there is a lecture series by Jonas Peters, held at MIT, that are available freely online.</p>
<p>From just viewing the first of the four lectures, I am thoroughly enjoying Jonas' explanations of the core ideas in causal modelling. Indeed, Jonas is a very talented lecturer! He builds up the ideas from simple examples, finally culminating in a "simple complex example" that we can simulate on a computer. Having just freshly read "The Book of Why" also helps immensely; it's also clear to me that people in the world of causal modelling are very much familiar with the same talking points.</p>

  <p>For any problem that we think is machine learnable, having a sane baseline is really important. It is even more important to establish them early.</p>
<p>Today at ODSC, I had a chance to meet both Andreas Mueller and Randy Olson. Andreas leads <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"><code>scikit-learn</code></a> development, while Randy was the lead developer of <a href="https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot">TPOT</a>, an AutoML tool. To both of them, I told a variation of the following story:</p>
<p>I had spent about 1.5 months building and testing a graph convolutions neural network model to predict RNA cleavage by an enzyme. I was suffering from a generalization problem - this model class would never generalize beyond the training samples for my problem on hand, even though I saw the same model class perform admirably well for small molecules and proteins.</p>
<p>Together with an engineer at NIBR, we brainstormed a baseline with some simple features, and threw a random forest model at it. Three minutes later, after implementing everything, we had a model that generalized and outperformed my implementation of graph CNNs. Three days later, we had an AutoML (TPOT) model that beat the random forest. After further discussion, we realize then that the work that we did is sufficiently publishable even without the fancy graph CNNs.</p>
<p>I think thereâ€™s a lesson in establishing baselines and MVPs early on!</p>

  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p><code>click</code> is amazing! It's a Python package that allows us to add a command-line interface (CLI) to our Python scripts easily. This blog post is a data scientist-oriented post on how we can use <code>click</code> to build useful tools for ourselves. In this blog post, I want to focus on how we can better organize our scripts.</p>
<p>I have found myself sometimes writing custom scripts to deal with custom data transforms. Having them refactored out into a library of modular functions can really help with maintenance. However, I still end up with multiple scripts that might not have a naturally logical organization... except for the fact that they are scripts that I run from time to time! Rather than have them scattered in multiple places, why not have them put together into a single <code>.py</code> file, with options that are callable from the command line instead?</p>
<h2 id="template">Template</h2><p>Here's a template for organizing all those messy scripts using  <code>click</code>.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">click</span>


<span class="nd">@click.group</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>


<span class="nd">@main.command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">script1</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">    Makes stuff happen.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="c1"># do stuff that was originally in script 1</span>
    <span class="n">click</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">echo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;script 1 was run!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># click.echo is recommended by the click authors.</span>


<span class="nd">@main.command</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">script2</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Makes more stuff happen.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="c1"># do stuff that was originally in script 2.</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;script 2 was run!&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># we can run print instead of click.echo as well!</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">cli</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use</h2><p>Let's call this new meta-script <code>jobs.py</code>, and make it executable.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>$ chmod +x jobs.py
</pre></div>
<p>To execute it at the command line, we now a help command for free:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>$ ./jobs.py --help
Usage: jobs.py <span class="o">[</span>OPTIONS<span class="o">]</span> COMMAND <span class="o">[</span>ARGS<span class="o">]</span>...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  script1  Makes stuff happen.
  script2  Makes more stuff happen.
</pre></div>
<p>We can also use just one script with varying commands to control the execution of what was originally two different <code>.py</code> files.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span>$ ./jobs.py script1
script <span class="m">1</span> was run!
$ ./jobs.py script2
script <span class="m">2</span> was run!
</pre></div>
<p>Instead of versioning multiple <code>.py</code> files, we now only have to keep track of one file where all non-standard custom stuff goes!</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2><p>Here's what's going on under the hood.</p>
<p>With the decorator <code>@click.group()</code>, we have exposed the <code>main()</code> function from the command line as a "group" of commands that are callable from the command line. What this does is then "wrap" the <code>main()</code> function (somehow), such that now it can be used to decorate another function (in our case, <code>script1</code> and <code>script2</code>) using the decorator syntax <code>@main.command()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2><ul>
<li>Consolidate disparate Python scripts into a single <code>.py</code>  file, wrapping them inside a callable function.</li>
<li>Use <code>click</code> to expose them to the end-user (yourself, or others) at the command line.</li>
</ul>

  </p>
  <p>At work, Iâ€™ve been rolling my own deep learning package to experiment with graph convolutional neural networks. I did this because in graph-centric deep learning, an idea I picked up from this paper, the inputs, convolution kernels, and much more, are being actively developed, and the standard APIs donâ€™t fit with this kind of data.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s lessons I learned (and reinforced) while doing this.</p>
<h2 id="autograd-is-an-amazing-package"><code>autograd</code> is an amazing package</h2><p>I am using <code>autograd</code> to write my neural networks. <code>autograd</code> provides a way to automatically differentiate <code>numpy</code> code. As long as I write the forward computation up to the loss function, <code>autograd</code> will be able to differentiate the loss function w.r.t. all of the parameters used, thus providing the direction to move parameters to minimize the loss function.</p>
<h2 id="deep-learning-is-nothing-more-than-chaining-elementary-differentiable-functions">Deep learning is nothing more than chaining elementary differentiable functions</h2><p>Linear regression is nothing more than a dot product of features with weights and adding bias terms. Logistic regression just chains the logistic function on top of that. Anything deeper than that is what we might call a neural network.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that I've begun to ponder is the shape of the loss function, and how it changes when I change model architecture, activation functions, and more. I can't speak intelligently about it right now, but from observing the training performance live (I update a plot of predictions vs. actual values at the end of <code>x</code> training epochs), different combinations of activation functions seem to cause different behaviours of the outputs, and there's no first-principles reason why that I can think of. All-told, pretty interesting :).</p>
<h2 id="defining-a-good-api-is-hard-work">Defining a good API is hard work</h2><p>There are design choices that go into the API design. I first off wanted to build something familiar, so I chose to emulate the functional API of Keras and PyTorch and Chainer. I also wanted composability, in which I can define modules of layers and chain them together, so I opted to use Python objects and to take advantage of their <code>__call__</code> method to achieve both goals. At the same time, <code>autograd</code> imposes a constraint in that I need to have functions differentiable with respect to their first argument, an array of parameters. Thus, I had to make sure the weights and biases are made transparently available for <code>autograd</code> to differentiate. As a positive side effect, it means I can actually inspect the parameters dictionary quite transparently.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-for-speed-is-a-very-hard-thing">Optimizing for speed is a very hard thing</h2><p>Even though I'm doing my best already with matrix math (and hopefully getting better at mastering 3-dimensional and higher matrix algebra), in order to keep my API clean and compatible with <code>autograd</code> (meaning no sparse arrays), I have opted to use lists of <code>numpy</code> arrays.</p>
<h2 id="graph-convolutions-have-a-connection-to-network-propagation">Graph convolutions have a connection to network propagation</h2><p>I will probably explore this a bit more deeply in another blog post, but yes, as I explore the math involved in doing graph convolutions, I'm noticing that there's a deep connection there. The short story is basically "convolutions propagate information across nodes" in almost exactly the same way as "network propagation methods share information across nodes", through the use of a kernel defined by the adjacency matrix of a graph.</p>
<p>Ok, that's a lot of jargon, but I promise I will explore this topic at a later time.</p>
<h2 id="open-sourcing">Open Sourcing</h2><p>I'm an avid open source fan. Lots of my work builds on it. However, because this "neural networks on graphs" work is developed on company time and for company use, this will very likely be the first software project that I send to Legal to evaluate whether I can open source/publish it or not -- I'll naturally have to make my strongest case for open sourcing the code base (e.g. ensuring no competitive intelligence is leaked), but eventually will still have to defer to them for a final decision.</p>
