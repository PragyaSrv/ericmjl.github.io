  <p><em>This blog post is cross-posted in my <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/workflow/code-review/">essays collection</a>.</em></p>
<p>The practice of code review is extremely beneficial to the practice of software engineering.
I believe it has its place in data science as well.</p>
<h2 id="what-code-review-is">What code review is</h2><p>Code review is the process by which a contributor's newly committed code
is reviewed by one or more teammate(s).
During the review process, the teammate(s) are tasked with ensuring that they</p>
<ul>
<li>understand the code and are able to follow the logic,</li>
<li>find potential flaws in the newly contributed code,</li>
<li>identify poorly documented code and confusing use of variable names,</li>
<li>raise constructive questions and provide constructive feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>on the codebase.</p>
<p>If you've done the practice of scientific research before,
it is essentially identical to peer review,
except with code being the thing being reviewed instead.</p>
<h2 id="what-code-review-_isn-t_">What code review <em>isn't</em></h2><p>Code review is not the time
for a senior person to slam the contributions of a junior person,
nor vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="why-data-scientists-should-do-code-review">Why data scientists should do code review</h2><p>The first reason is to ensure that project knowledge
is shared amongst teammates.
By doing this, we ensure that
in case the original code creator needs to be offline for whatever reason,
others on the team cover for that person and pick up the analysis.
When N people review the code, N+1 people know what went on.
(It does not necessarily have to be N == number of people on the team.)</p>
<p>In the context of notebooks, this is even more important.
An analysis is complex,
and involves multiple modelling decisions and assumptions.
Raising these questions,
and pointing out where those assumptions should be documented
(particularly in the notebook)
is a good way of ensuring
that N+1 people know those implicit assumptions that go into the model.</p>
<p>The second reason is that
even so-called "senior" data scientists are humans,
and will make mistakes.
With my interns and less-experienced colleagues,
I will invite them to constructively raise queries about my code
where it looks confusing to them.
Sometimes, their lack of experience gives me an opportunity to explain
and share design considerations during the code review process,
but at other times, they are correct, and I have made a mistake in my code
that should be rectified.</p>
<h2 id="what-code-review-can-be">What code review can be</h2><p>Code review can become a very productive time of learning for all parties.
What it takes is the willingness to listen to the critique provided,
and the willingness to raise issues on the codebase in a constructive fashion.</p>
<h2 id="how-code-review-happens">How code review happens</h2><p>Code review happens usually in the context of a pull request
to merge contributed code into the master branch.
The major version control system hosting platforms (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab)
all provide an interface to show the "diff"
(i.e. newly contributed or deleted code)
and comment directly on the code, in context.</p>
<p>As such, code review can happen entirely asynchronously, across time zones,
and without needing much in-person interaction.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to sync up either via a video call,
or by meeting up in person,
has numerous advantages by allowing non-verbal communication to take place.
This helps with building trust between teammates,
and hence doing even "virtual" in-person reviews
can be a way of being inclusive towards remote colleagues.</p>
<h2 id="parting-words">Parting words</h2><p>If your firm is set up to use a version control system,
then you probably have the facilities to do code review available.
I hope this essay encourages you to give it a try.</p>

  <p>Those who think “AI will solve medicine” are delusional.
I say this as a practitioner of machine learning in drug discovery and development.</p>
<p>First things first, “AI” is an overused term.
We should stop using it, especially in medicinal research.</p>
<p>Now, my thoughts are more sanguine.
The real value proposition of machine learning models in drug development
is to navigate chemical, sequence, pathway, and knowledge space
faster and smarter than we might otherwise do so
without machine learning methods.
It’s a modeling tool, and nothing more than that.
It’s a tool for helping the human collective make better decisions than without it,
but it’s also a double-edged sword.
We can use the tool and then constrain our thinking because we have that tool,
because we want to continue using that tool.
Or we can use the tool to our advantage
and liberate our mind to think of other things.</p>
<p>This thought was sparked off by an email that I was on at work.
A molecule was approved for <em>continued investigation</em> (not even “go for safety trials”!),
and 63 people were on that email.
Imagine the number of people
who are involved in getting a molecule past all research-phase checkpoints
<em>and</em> all 3 clinical trial checkpoints.
<em>Hint: Many people are involved.</em></p>
<p>As I combed through the names on that email,
the number of machine learners was vastly outnumbered by the number of colleagues
who toiled daily at the bench,
wrangling with even more uncertainty than that we have at our computers.
We machine learners work in service of them,
delivering insights and prioritized directions,
just as they toil to generate the data that our data-hungry models need.
It’s a symbiotic relationship.</p>
<p>What do all of those 63 people work on?</p>
<p>Some make the molecules.
Others design the assays to test the molecules in.
Yet others design the assays to find the target to then develop the assay for.
It’s many layers of human creativity in the loop.
I can’t automate the entirety of their work with my software tools, but I can augment them.
I mean, yeah, I can find a new potential target,
but ultimately it's a molecular biologist
who develops the assay, especially if that assay has never existed before.</p>
<p>There are others who professionally manage the progress of the project.
There’s sufficient complexity at the bench
and in the silicon chips
that we can’t each keep track of the big picture.
Someone has to do that, and keep everybody focused.</p>
<p>And then there’s the handful of us who deal with numbers and mainly just numbers.
Yes, it’s a handful.
I counted them on my fingers.
We do have an outsized impact compared to our numbers,
but that’s because we can get computers to do our repetitive work for us.
At the bench, robots are harder to work with.
Having been at the bench before and failing badly at it,
I can very much empathize with how tedious the work is.
It’s expensive to collect that data,
so the onus is on us computation types to get help navigate “data space” more smartly.</p>

  <p>I found this nifty tool for caching the results of long-running functions: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cachier/"><code>cachier</code></a>. This is useful when we’re building, say, Python applications for which quick interactions are necessary, or for caching the results of a long database query.</p>
<p>How do we use it? Basically it’s nothing more than a decorator!</p>
<p>Let’s imagine I have a long-running function as below.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">long_running_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># stuff happens</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Turns out, if you have a need to cache the result in a lightweight fashion, you can simply add <code>cachier</code>:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">cachier</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">cachier</span>

<span class="nd">@cachier</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">long_running_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># stuff happens</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The result is stored in your home directory, so the cache is accessible to you.</p>
<p>One nice thing <code>cachier</code> also offers is the ability to set a time duration after which the cache goes stale. This can be useful in situations where you know that you need to refresh the cache, such as a database query that may go stale because of new data added into it. This is done by specifying the <code>stale_after</code> keyword argument:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">cachier</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">cachier</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">datetime</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">timedelta</span>

<span class="c1"># Re-cache result after 1 week.</span>
<span class="nd">@cachier</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stale_after</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">timedelta</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">weeks</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">long_running_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># stuff happens</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you need to reset the cache manually, you can always do:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">long_running_function</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">clear_cache</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There are other advanced features that <code>cachier</code> provides, and so I’d encourage you to go and take a look at it!</p>

  <p>Recording this for myself, since I did it once and probably don't have the brain bandwidth to remember this through repetition.</p>
<p>I have known how to run a "public" Jupyter server (password-protected, naturally), but one thing I've struggled with was getting HTTPS working.</p>
<p>Turns out, the <code>letsencrypt</code> instructions aren't that bad on Jupyter's docs. I just was ignorant in the past, and didn't know enough about Linux to get this working right.</p>
<p>The key here is creating a <code>letsencrypt</code> certificate, and making sure file permissions are set correctly.</p>
<p>First off, go to the <a href="https://certbot.eff.org">Certbot page</a>. Select the type of website you're running and operating system. For Jupyter, I chose "None of the Above" and "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic)" (even though I'm technically on Ubuntu 19). (Here's a <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntubionic-other">shortcut link</a> to the instructions if you're in the same situation.)</p>
<p>On my system (Ubuntu-based), I used the following commands to install <code>certbot</code>:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Add repository</span>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update

<span class="c1"># Install certbot</span>
sudo apt-get install certbot

<span class="c1"># Run certbot</span>
sudo certbot certonly --standalone
</pre></div>
<p>Follow the instructions. <code>certbot</code> will install into a protected directory. In my case, it was <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/&lt;mywebsite&gt;/</code>.</p>
<p>Here, a problem will show up. That directory above is not accessible by a Jupyter server run under a user other than <code>root</code>. But a desired property of running Jupyter servers is that we don't have to use <code>sudo</code> to run it. How can we solve this? Basically, by making sure that the certificate is readable by a non-<code>root</code> user.</p>
<p>What I did, then, was to copy the files that were created by <code>certbot</code> into a location under my home directory. For security by obscurity, I'm naturally not revealing its identity. Then, I changed ownership of those files to my username:</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">pwd</span>  <span class="c1"># you should be in the directory where the certbot-created files are located</span>
su -
chown &lt;myusername&gt; *.pem  <span class="c1"># changes ownership of those files</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, I went into my Jupyter config (<code>~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py</code>, this is well-known), and edited the two lines that specified the "certfile" and the "keyfile":</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NotebookApp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">certfile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mycert.pem&#39;</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NotebookApp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">keyfile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;/absolute/path/to/your/certificate/mykey.key&#39;</span>
</pre></div>

  <p>Do people learn better by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generalizing from one example explained well, or by</li>
<li>Having multiple case studies that highlight the same point?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think both are needed, but I am also torn sometimes by whether it’s more effective to communicate using the former or the latter.</p>
<p>Case in point: In teaching Bayesian statistics, the coin flip is a particular case of the Beta-Binomial model. However, the Beta-Binomial model can be taken from its most elementary form (estimation on one group) through to its most sophisticated form (hierarchically estimating <code>p</code>).</p>
<p>I guess if the goal is to show how broadly applicable a given model class (i.e. the beta-binomial model) is, a teacher would elect to jump between multiple examples that are apparently distinct. However, if the goal is build depth (i.e. going from single group to multiple group estimation), sticking with one example (e.g. of baseball players, classically) would be the better strategy.</p>
<p>Both are needed, just at different times, I think. Thinking through this example, I think, gives me a first-principles way of deciding which approach to go for.</p>
