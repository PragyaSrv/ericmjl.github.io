  <!-- Put post body -->
  <p>I have received questions from others on how to build a digital profile for career development. Everybody’s going to have a unique path, and what I think I can offer are observations on what I think have been helpful for myself and others who have enjoyed similar successes in getting started. My hope is that these pointers, which come from self-reflection over the past two years of work, help you.</p>
<h2 id="the-maybe-timeless-and-cross-industry-principles">The maybe-timeless and cross-industry principles</h2><p>First off, here are some things that I think are timeless principles in the job search, and are probably true for a large swathe of professional roles.</p>
<p>Firstly, nobody owes me their time or a job; <strong>I have a lot of leeway to make it as easy as possible for others to say, “Yes, I would like to have you on board”</strong>. Naturally, this statement ignores structural privileges and inequalities that exist in society, so I would be realistic in what I can accomplish. That said, it's usually a good prior to assume that everybody is busy, and that you need to properly advertise what you can offer.</p>
<p>In line with the same idea, I start with the presumption that nobody has the spare time to think deeply about a candidate when there are many other things in one's mind. The corollary is that <strong>it is on me to frame how I want others to view me</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="data-science-specific-things">Data science-specific things</h2><p>Now, for a data science role, being able to demonstrate the following can only help, not hurt, your application and candidacy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to use your skills to solve real problems of value.</li>
<li>Good coding practices.</li>
<li>Good storytelling and communication ability.</li>
<li>Proficiency with building "products" that aid in decision-making.</li>
<li>Ability to work collaboratively with others.</li>
</ol>
<p>In data science, “value” usually means saving money. Saving time = saving money, in case that was not clear. Hence, automation <em>is</em> valuable.</p>
<p>Good coding practices are important: I have an <a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/software-skills/">essay collection</a> on them, if you need a resource to get started.</p>
<p>Communication skills are universally important in professional roles, and data science is no different.</p>
<p>What does enhance communication is the ability to build interactive tools that guide a busy decision-maker towards ethical and profitable choices (hopefully in that order). Good value judgment is needed here!</p>
<h2 id="where-are-prospective-hiring-teams-going-to-look?">Where are prospective hiring teams going to look?</h2><p>This comes from <code>n=7</code> candidates for (I think) 3 candidate searches at work that I was involved in. The order in which I was looking was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resume</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>Personal website</li>
<li>Google Scholar</li>
<li>Old/current research group website</li>
</ol>
<p>The resume is what you turn in. Make sure it's clean, readable, and that it concisely captures exactly what you're looking to communicate to the hiring team: how you're going to be a good fit for the role.</p>
<p>When I looked at LinkedIn, I was, quite interestingly, looking at their social network. Who might they plausibly know? At least for the team I'm on, I know credentials and certifications matter less than evidence of projects done, which brings me to the next place...</p>
<p>GitHub. I was looking for evidence of candidates' ability to code. A well fleshed-out GitHub profile with publicly browsable repositories and a contribution record that is mostly your own makes it so much easier to see your coding style. I also looked for evidence of familiarity with packages, continuous integration tooling, good version control, and collaborations with other package developers.</p>
<p>Your projects that demonstrate the data science skills above should be prominently featured on your profile page. Project types that, in contemporary times, communicate these skills well include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data products that you've built</li>
<li>Teaching material that you've made</li>
<li>Contributions you've made to other repositories, in particular pull requests and issues politely raised.</li>
</ol>
<p>I looked at Google Scholar as well to get a flavour for a candidate's prior research work. It's an indication of one's domain expertise, and <em>possibly</em> an indicator of the kinds of problems one will gravitate towards. (This last point has been at least true for myself; however, for one jumping from, say, biological data science to flight data science, this will be much less relevant.)</p>
<p>The diversity of one's collaborators also helps paint a picture: did you specialize in work with one other person all of your academic career, or did you work in large teams, or did you work mostly solo? (Don't put a value judgment so quickly: each has their own strengths.)</p>
<p>A candidate's old research group is something I would check only out of curiosity, just to know more.</p>
<h2 id="the-kitchen-sink-of-tips">The kitchen sink of tips</h2><p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> if you put your source code on GitHub, always include in the README why the repository exists, and a guide to how to use the repository. It is a marker of "sociable working style": in other words, you're able to think of how others are going to interact with things that you've created. (Using others' tools happens all the time at work!)</p>
<p><strong>Tip #2:</strong> If you put a notebook up in your repository, be sure to make the repo <a href="https://mybinder.org/">Binder-friendly</a>. It doesn't take much: environment spec file is all thats needed!</p>
